    <p>
      Publish any sort of conviction related to these morose days through which
      we are living and letters will shower upon you like leaves in October. No
      matter what your conviction be, it will shake both yeas and nays loose
      from various minds where they were hanging ready to fall. Never was a time
      when so many brains rustled with hates and panaceas that would sail wide
      into the air at the lightest jar. Try it and see. Say that you believe in
      God, or do not; say that Democracy is the key to the millennium, or the
      survival of the unfittest; that Labor is worse than the Kaiser, or better;
      that drink is a demon, or that wine ministers to the health and the cheer
      of man&mdash;say what you please, and the yeas and nays will pelt you. So
      insecurely do the plainest, oldest truths dangle in a mob of disheveled
      brains, that it is likely, did you assert twice two continues to equal
      four and we had best stick to the multiplication table, anonymous letters
      would come to you full of passionate abuse. Thinking comes hard to all of
      us. To some it never comes at all, because their heads lack the machinery.
      How many of such are there among us, and how can we find them out before
      they do us harm? Science has a test for this. It has been applied to the
      army recruit, but to the civilian voter not yet. The voting moron still
      runs amuck in our Democracy. Our native American air is infected with
      alien breath. It is so thick with opinions that the light is obscured.
      Will the sane ones eventually prevail and heal the sick atmosphere? We
      must at least assume so. Else, how could we go on?

    <h2>
      Chapter II: What the Postman Brought
    </h2>
    <p>
      During the winter of 1915 I came to think that Germany had gone
      dangerously but methodically mad, and that the European War vitally
      concerned ourselves. This conviction I put in a book. Yeas and nays pelted
      me. Time seems to show the yeas had it.
    </p>
    <p>
      During May, 1918, I thought we made a mistake to hate England. I said so
      at the earliest opportunity. Again came the yeas and nays. You shall see
      some of these. They are of help. Time has not settled this question. It is
      as alive as ever&mdash;more alive than ever. What if the Armistice was
      premature? What if Germany absorb Russia and join Japan? What if the
      League of Nations break like a toy?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yeas and nays are put here without the consent of their writers, whose
      names, of course, do not appear, and who, should they ever see this, are
      begged to take no offense. None is intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no intention except to persuade, if possible, a few readers, at
      least, that hatred of England is not wise, is not justified to-day, and
      has never been more than partly justified. It is based upon three
      foundations fairly distinct yet meeting and merging on occasions: first
      and worst, our school histories of the Revolution; second, certain
      policies and actions of England since then, generally distorted or
      falsified by our politicians; and lastly certain national traits in each
      country that the other does not share and which have hitherto produced
      perennial personal friction between thousands of English and American
      individuals of every station in life. These shall in due time be
      illustrated by two sets of anecdotes: one, disclosing the English traits,
      the other the American. I say English, and not British, advisedly, because
      both the Scotch and the Irish seem to be without those traits which
      especially grate upon us and upon which we especially grate. And now for
      the letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first is from a soldier, an enlisted man, writing from France.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me to thank you for your article entitled &lsquo;The Ancient Grudge.&rsquo; ...
      Like many other young Americans there was instilled in me from early
      childhood a feeling of resentment against our democratic cousins across
      the Atlantic and I was only too ready to accept as true those stories I
      heard of England shirking her duty and hiding behind her colonies, etc. It
      was not until I came over here and saw what she was really doing that my
      opinion began to change.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When first my division arrived in France it was brigaded with and
      received its initial experience with the British, who proved to us how
      little we really knew of the war as it was and that we had yet much to
      learn. Soon my opinion began to change and I was regarding England as the
      backbone of the Allies. Yet there remained a certain something I could not
      forgive them. What it was you know, and have proved to me that it is not
      our place to judge and that we have much for which to be thankful to our
      great Ally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Assuring you that your... article has succeeded in converting one who
      needed conversion badly I beg to remain....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How many American soldiers in Europe, I wonder, have looked about them,
      have used their sensible independent American brains (our very best
      characteristic), have left school histories and hearsay behind them and
      judged the English for themselves? A good many, it is to be hoped. What
      that judgment finally becomes must depend not alone upon the personal
      experience of each man. It must also come from that liberality of outlook
      which is attained only by getting outside your own place and seeing a lot
      of customs and people that differ from your own. A mind thus seasoned and
      balanced no longer leaps to an opinion about a whole nation from the
      sporadic conduct of individual members of it. It is to be feared that some
      of our soldiers may never forget or make allowance for a certain insult
      they received in the streets of London. But of this later. The following
      sentence is from a letter written by an American sailor:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have read... &lsquo;The Ancient Grudge&rsquo; and I wish it could be read by every
      man on our big ship as I know it would change a lot of their attitude
      toward England. I have argued with lots of them and have shown some of
      them where they are wrong but the Catholics and descendants of Ireland
      have a different argument and as my education isn&rsquo;t very great, I know
      very little about what England did to the Catholics in Ireland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ireland I shall discuss later. Ireland is no more our business to-day than
      the South was England&rsquo;s business in 1861. That the Irish question should
      defeat an understanding between ourselves and England would be, to quote
      what a gentleman who is at once a loyal Catholic and a loyal member of the
      British Government said to me, &ldquo;wrecking the ship for a ha&rsquo;pennyworth of
      tar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The following is selected from the nays, and was written by a business
      man. I must not omit to say that the writers of all these letters are
      strangers to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As one American citizen to another... permit me to give my personal view
      on your subject of &lsquo;The Ancient Grudge&rsquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To begin with, I think that you start with a false idea of our kinship&mdash;with
      the idea that America, because she speaks the language of England, because
      our laws and customs are to a great extent of the same origin, because
      much that is good among us came from there also, is essentially of English
      character, bound up in some way with the success or failure of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, in my opinion, could be further from the truth. We are a
      distinctive race&mdash;no more English, nationally, than the present King
      George is German&mdash;as closely related and as alike as a celluloid comb
      and a stick of dynamite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are bound up in the success of America only. The English are bound up
      in the success of England only. We are as friendly as rival corporations.
      We can unite in a common cause, as we have, but, once that is over, we
      will go our own way&mdash;which way, owing to the increase of our shipping
      and foreign trade, is likely to become more and more antagonistic to
      England&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;England has been a commercially unscrupulous nation for generations and
      it is idle to throw the blame for this or that act of a nation on an
      individual. Such arguments might be kept up indefinitely as regards an act
      of any country. A responsible nation must bear the praise or odium that
      attaches to any national action. If England has experienced a change of
      heart it has occurred since the days of the Boer Republic&mdash;as wanton
      a steal as Belgium, with even less excuse, and attended with sufficient
      brutality for all practical purposes....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has done us many an ill turn gratuitously and not a single good turn
      that was not dictated by selfish policy or jealousy of others. She has
      shown herself, up till yesterday at least, grasping and unscrupulous. She
      is no worse than the others probably&mdash;possibly even better&mdash;but
      it would be doing our country an ill turn to persuade its citizens that
      England was anything less than an active, dangerous, competitor,
      especially in the infancy of our foreign trade. When a business rival
      gives you the glad hand and asks fondly after the children, beware lest
      the ensuing emotions cost you money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No: our distrust for England has not its life and being in pernicious
      textbooks. To really believe that would be an insult to our intelligence&mdash;even
      grudges cannot live without real food. Should England become helpless
      tomorrow, our animosity and distrust would die to-morrow, because we would
      know that she had it no longer in her power to injure us. Therein lies the
      feeling&mdash;the textbooks merely echo it....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In my opinion, a navy somewhat larger than England&rsquo;s would practically
      eliminate from America that &lsquo;Ancient Grudge&rsquo; you deplore. It is England&rsquo;s
      navy&mdash;her boasted and actual control of the seas&mdash;which
      threatens and irritates every nation on the face of the globe that has
      maritime aspirations. She may use it with discretion, as she has for
      years. It may even be at times a source of protection to others, as it has&mdash;but
      so long as it exists as a supreme power it is a constant source of danger
      and food for grudges.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will never be a free nation until our navy surpasses England&rsquo;s. The
      world will never be a free world until the seas and trade routes are free
      to all, at all times, and without any menace, however benevolent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In conclusion... allow me to again state that I write as one American
      citizen to another with not the slightest desire to say anything that may
      be personally obnoxious. My own ancestors were from England. My personal
      relations with the Englishmen I have met have been very pleasant. I can
      readily believe that there are no better people living, but I feel so
      strongly on the subject, nationally&mdash;so bitterly opposed to a
      continuance of England&rsquo;s sea control&mdash;so fearful that our people may
      be lulled into a feeling of false security, that I cannot help trying to
      combat, with every small means in my power, anything that seems to
      propagate a dangerous friendship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I received no dissenting letter superior to this. To the writer of it I
      replied that I agreed with much that he said, but that even so it did not
      in my opinion outweigh the reasons I had given (and shall now give more
      abundantly) in favor of dropping our hostile feeling toward England.
    </p>
    <p>
      My correspondent says that we differ as a race from the English as much as
      a celluloid comb from a stick of dynamite. Did our soldiers find the
      difference as great as that? I doubt if our difference from anybody is
      quite as great as that. Again, my correspondent says that we are bound up
      in our own success only, and England is bound up in hers only. I agree.
      But suppose the two successes succeed better through friendship than
      through enmity? We are as friendly, my correspondent says, as two rival
      corporations. Again I agree. Has it not been proved this long while that
      competing corporations prosper through friendship? Did not the Northern
      Pacific and the Great Northern form a combination called the Northern
      Securities, for the sake of mutual benefit? Under the Sherman Act the
      Northern Securities was dissolved; but no Sherman act forbids a Liberty
      Securities. Liberty, defined and assured by Law, is England&rsquo;s gift to the
      modern world. Liberty, defined and assured by Law, is the central purpose
      of our Constitution. Just as identically as the Northern Pacific and Great
      Northern run from St. Paul to Seattle do England and the United States aim
      at Liberty, defined and assured by Law. As friends, the two nations can
      swing the world towards world stability. My correspondent would hardly
      have instanced the Boers in his reference to England&rsquo;s misdeeds, had he
      reflected upon the part the Boers have played in England&rsquo;s struggle with
      Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will point out no more of the latent weaknesses that underlie various
      passages in this letter, but proceed to the remaining letters that I have
      selected. I gave one from an enlisted man and one from a sailor; this is
      from a commissioned officer, in France.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot refrain from sending you a line of appreciation and thanks for
      giving the people at home a few facts that I am sure some do not know and
      throwing a light upon a much discussed topic, which I am sure will help to
      remove from some of their minds a foolish bigoted antipathy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon the single point of our school histories of the Revolution, some of
      which I had named as being guilty of distorting the facts, a correspondent
      writes from Nebraska:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some months ago... the question came to me, what about our Montgomery&rsquo;s
      History now.... I find that everywhere it is the King who is represented
      as taking these measures against the American people. On page 134 is the
      heading, American Commerce; the new King George III; how he interfered
      with trade; page 135, The King proposes to tax the Colonies; page 136,
      &lsquo;The best men in Parliament&mdash;such men as William Pitt and Edmund
      Burke&mdash;took the side of the colonies.&rsquo; On page 138, &lsquo;William Pitt
      said in Parliament, &ldquo;in my opinion, this kingdom has no right to lay a tax
      on the colonies... I rejoice that America has resisted&rdquo;&rsquo;; page 150, &lsquo;The
      English people would not volunteer to fight the Americans and the King had
      to hire nearly 30,000 Hessians to help do the work.... The Americans had
      not sought separation; the King&mdash;not the English people&mdash;had
      forced it on them....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am writing this... because, as I was glad to see, you did not mince
      words in naming several of the worse offenders.&rdquo; (He means certain school
      histories that I mentioned and shall mention later again.)
    </p>
    <p>
      An official from Pittsburgh wrote thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In common with many other people, I have had the same idea that England
      was not doing all she could in the war, that while her colonies were in
      the thick of it, she, herself, seemed to be sparing herself, but after
      reading this article... I will frankly and candidly confess to you that it
      has changed my opinion, made me a strong supporter of England, and above
      all made me a better American.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From Massachusetts:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well to remind your readers of the errors&mdash;or worse&mdash;in
      American school text books and to recount Britain&rsquo;s achievements in the
      present war. But of what practical avail are these things when a man so
      highly placed as the present Secretary of the Navy asks a Boston audience
      (Tremont Temple, October 30, 1918) to believe that it was the American
      navy which made possible the transportation of over 2,000,000 Americans to
      France without the loss of a single transport on the way over? Did he not
      know that the greater part of those troops were not only transported, but
      convoyed, by British vessels, largely withdrawn for that purpose from such
      vital service as the supply of food to Britain&rsquo;s civil population?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The omission on the part of our Secretary of the Navy was later quietly
      rectified by an official publication of the British Government, wherein it
      appeared that some sixty per cent of our troops were transported in
      British ships. Our Secretary&rsquo;s regrettable slight to our British allies
      was immediately set right by Admiral Sims, who forthwith, both in public
      and in private, paid full and appreciative tribute to what had been done.
      It is, nevertheless, very likely that some Americans will learn here for
      the first time that more than half of our troops were not transported by
      ourselves, and could not have been transported at all but for British
      assistance. There are many persons who still believe what our politicians
      and newspapers tell them. No incident that I shall relate further on
      serves better to point the chief international moral at which I am driving
      throughout these pages, and at which I have already hinted: Never to
      generalize the character of a whole nation by the acts of individual
      members of it. That is what everybody does, ourselves, the English, the
      French, everybody. You can form no valid opinion of any nation&rsquo;s
      characteristics, not even your own, until you have met hundreds of its
      people, men and women, and had ample opportunity to observe and know them
      beneath the surface. Here on the one hand we had our Secretary of the
      Navy. He gave our Navy the whole credit for getting our soldiers overseas.
    </p>
    <p>
      He justified the British opinion that we are a nation of braggarts. On the
      other hand, in London, we had Admiral Sims, another American, a splendid
      antidote. He corrected the Secretary&rsquo;s brag. What is the moral? Look out
      how you generalize. Since we entered the war that tribe of English has
      increased who judge us with an open mind, discriminate between us, draw
      close to a just appraisal of our qualities and defects, and possibly even
      discern that those who fill our public positions are mostly on a lower
      level than those who elect them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I proceed with two more letters, both dissenting, and both giving very
      typically, as it seems to me, the American feeling about England&mdash;partially
      justified by instances mentioned by my correspondent, but equally
      mentioned by me in passages which he seems to have skipped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lately I read and did not admire your article... &lsquo;The Ancient Grudge.&rsquo; 
      Many of your statements are absolutely true, and I recognize the fact that
      England&rsquo;s help in this war has been invaluable. Let it go at that and
      hush!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not defend our own Indian policy.... Wounded and disabled in our
      Indian wars... I know all about them and how indefensible they are.....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;England has been always our only legitimate enemy. 1776? Yes, call it
      ancient history and forget it if possible. 1812? That may go in the same
      category. But the causes of that misunderstanding were identically
      repeated in 1914 and &lsquo;15.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;1861? Is that also ancient? Perhaps&mdash;but very bitter in the memory
      of many of us now living. The Alabama. The Confederate Commissioners (I
      know you will say we were wrong there&mdash;and so we may have been
      technically&mdash;but John Bull bullied us into compliance when our hands
      were tied). Lincoln told his Cabinet &lsquo;one war at a time, Gentlemen&rsquo; and
      submitted....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In 1898 we were a strong and powerful nation and a dangerous enemy to
      provoke. England recognized the fact and acted accordingly. England
      entered the present war to protect small nations! Heaven save the mark!
      You surely read your history. Pray tell me something of England&rsquo;s policy
      in South Africa, India, the Soudan, Persia, Abyssinia, Ireland, Egypt. The
      lost provinces of Denmark. The United States when she was young and
      helpless. And thus, almost to&mdash;infinitum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not know that the foundations of ninety per cent of the great
      British fortunes came from the loot of India? upheld and fostered by the
      great and unscrupulous East India Company?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come down to later times: to-day for instance. Here in California... I
      meet and associate with hundreds of Britishers. Are they American
      citizens? I had almost said, &lsquo;No, not one.&rsquo; Sneering and contemptuous of
      America and American institutions. Continually finding fault with our
      government and our people. Comparing these things with England, always to
      our disadvantage......
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now do you wonder we do not like England? Am I pro-German? I should laugh
      and so would you if you knew me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this correspondent I did not reply that I wished I knew him&mdash;which
      I do&mdash;that, even as he, so I had frequently been galled by the
      rudeness and the patronizing of various specimens, high and low, of the
      English race. But something I did reply, to the effect that I asked nobody
      to consider England flawless, or any nation a charitable institution, but
      merely to be fair, and to consider a cordial understanding between us
      greatly to our future advantage. To this he answered, in part, as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to thank you for your kindly reply.... Your argument is that as a
      matter of policy we should conciliate Great Britain. Have we fallen so
      low, this great and powerful nation?... Truckling to some other power
      because its backing, moral or physical, may some day be of use to us, even
      tho&rsquo; we know that in so doing we are surrendering our dearest rights,
      principles, and dignity!... Oh! my dear Sir, you surely do not advocate
      this? I inclose an editorial clipping.... Is it no shock to you when
      Winston Churchill shouts to High Heaven that under no circumstances will
      Great Britain surrender its supreme control of the seas? This in reply to
      President Wilson&rsquo;s plea for freedom of the seas and curtailment of
      armaments.... But as you see, our President and our Mr. Daniels have
      already said, &lsquo;Very well, we will outbuild you.&rsquo; Never again shall Great
      Britain stop our mail ships and search our private mails. Already has
      England declared an embargo against our exports in many essential lines
      and already are we expressing our dissatisfaction and taking means to
      retaliate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of the editorial clipping inclosed with the above, the following is a
      part:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John Bull is our associate in the contest with the Kaiser. There is no
      doubt as to his position on that proposition. He went after the Dutch in
      great shape. Next to France he led the way and said, &lsquo;Come on, Yanks; we
      need your help. We will put you in the first line of trenches where there
      will be good gunning. Yes, we will do all of that and at the same time we
      will borrow your money, raised by Liberty Loans, and use it for the
      purchase of American wheat, pork, and beef.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bull kept his word. He never flinched or attempted to dodge the
      issue. He kept strictly in the middle of the road. His determination to
      down the Kaiser with American men, American money, and American food never
      abated for a single day during the conflict.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This editorial has many twins throughout the country. I quote it for its
      value as a specimen of that sort of journalistic and political utterance
      amongst us, which is as seriously embarrassed by facts as a skunk by its
      tail. Had its author said: &ldquo;The Declaration of Independence was signed by
      Christopher Columbus on Washington&rsquo;s birthday during the siege of
      Vicksburg in the presence of Queen Elizabeth and Judas Iscariot,&rdquo; his
      statement would have been equally veracious, and more striking.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Winston Churchill&rsquo;s declaration that Great Britain will not
      surrender her control of the seas, I am as little shocked by that as I
      should be were our Secretary of the Navy to declare that in no
      circumstances would we give up control of the Panama Canal. The Panama
      Canal is our carotid artery, Great Britain&rsquo;s navy is her jugular vein. It
      is her jugular vein in the mind of her people, regardless of that new
      apparition, the submarine. I was not shocked that Great Britain should
      decline Mr. Wilson&rsquo;s invitation that she cut her jugular vein; it was the
      invitation which kindled my emotions; but these were of a less serious
      kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last letter that I shall give is from an American citizen of English
      birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a boy at school in England, I was taught the history of the American
      Revolution as J. R. Green presents it in his Short History of the English
      People. The gist of this record, as you doubtless recollect, is that
      George III being engaged in the attempt to destroy what there then was of
      political freedom and representative government in England, used the
      American situation as a means to that end; that the English people, in so
      far as their voice could make itself heard, were solidly against both his
      English and American policy, and that the triumph of America contributed
      in no small measure to the salvation of those institutions by which the
      evolution of England towards complete democracy was made possible.
      Washington was held up to us in England not merely as a great and good
      man, but as an heroic leader, to whose courage and wisdom the English as
      well as the American people were eternally indebted....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray forgive so long a letter from a stranger. It is prompted... by a
      sense of the illimitable importance, not only for America and Britain, but
      for the entire world, of these two great democratic peoples knowing each
      other as they really are and cooperating as only they can cooperate to
      establish and maintain peace on just and permanent foundations.&rdquo;

      Chapter III: In Front of a Bulletin Board
    </h2>
    <p>
      There, then, are ten letters of the fifty which came to me in consequence
      of what I wrote in May, 1918, which was published in the American Magazine
      for the following November. Ten will do. To read the other forty would
      change no impression conveyed already by the ten, but would merely repeat
      it. With varying phraseology their writers either think we have hitherto
      misjudged England and that my facts are to the point, or they express the
      stereotyped American antipathy to England and treat my facts as we mortals
      mostly do when facts are embarrassing&mdash;side-step them. What best
      pleased me was to find that soldiers and sailors agreed with me, and not
      &ldquo;high-brows&rdquo; only.
    </p>
    <p>
      May, 1918, as you will remember, was a very dark hour. We had come into
      the war, had been in for a year; but events had not yet taken us out of
      the well-nigh total eclipse flung upon our character by those blighting
      words, &ldquo;there is such a thing as being too proud to fight.&rdquo; The British
      had been told by their General that they were fighting with their backs to
      the wall. Since March 23rd the tread of the Hun had been coming steadily
      nearer to Paris. Belleau Wood and Chateau-Thierry had not yet struck the
      true ring from our metal and put into the hands of Foch the one further
      weapon that he needed. French morale was burning very low and blue. Yet
      even in such an hour, people apparently American and apparently grown up,
      were talking against England, our ally. Then and thereafter, even as
      to-day, they talked against her as they had been talking since August,
      1914, as I had heard them again and again, indoors and out, as I heard a
      man one forenoon in a crowd during the earlier years of the war, the
      miserable years before we waked from our trance of neutrality, while our
      chosen leaders were still misleading us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you remember those unearthly years? The explosions, the plots, the
      spies, the Lucitania, the notes, Mr. Bryan, von Bernstorff, half our
      country&mdash;oh, more than half!&mdash;in different or incredulous,
      nothing prepared, nothing done, no step taken, Theodore Roosevelt&rsquo;s and
      Leonard Wood&rsquo;s almost the only voices warning us what was bound to happen,
      and to get ready for it? Do you remember the bulletin boards? Did you
      grow, as I did, so restless that you would step out of your office to see
      if anything new had happened during the last sixty minutes&mdash;would
      stop as you went to lunch and stop as you came back? We knew from the
      faces of our friends what our own faces were like. In company we pumped up
      liveliness, but in the street, alone with our apprehensions&mdash;do you
      remember? For our future&rsquo;s sake may everybody remember, may nobody forget!
    </p>
    <p>
      What the news was upon a certain forenoon memorable to me, I do not
      recall, and this is of no consequence; good or bad, the stream of
      by-passers clotted thickly to read it as the man chalked it line upon line
      across the bulletin board. Citizens who were in haste stepped off the curb
      to pass round since they could not pass through this crowd of gazers. Thus
      this on the sidewalk stood some fifty of us, staring at names we had never
      known until a little while ago, Bethincourt, Malancourt, perhaps, or
      Montfaucon, or Roisel; French names of small places, among whose crumbled,
      featureless dust I have walked since, where lived peacefully a few hundred
      or a few thousand that are now a thousand butchered or broken-hearted.
      Through me ran once again the wonder that had often chilled me since the
      abdication of the Czar which made certain the crumbling of Russia: after
      France, was our turn coming? Should our fields, too, be sown with bones,
      should our little towns among the orchards and the corn fall in ashes
      amongst which broken hearts would wander in search of some surviving stick
      of property? I had learned to know that a long while before the war the
      eyes of the Hun, the bird of prey, had been fixed upon us as a juicy
      morsel. He had written it, he had said it. Since August, 1914, these
      Pan-German schemes had been leaking out for all who chose to understand
      them. A great many did not so choose. The Hun had wanted us and planned to
      get us, and now more than ever before, because he intended that we should
      pay his war bills. Let him once get by England, and his sword would cut
      through our fat, defenseless carcass like a knife through cheese.
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice arrested my reverie, a voice close by in the crowd. It said,
      &ldquo;Well, I like the French. But I&rsquo;ll not cry much if England gets hers.
      What&rsquo;s England done in this war, anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her fleet&rsquo;s keeping the Kaiser out of your front yard, for one thing,&rdquo;
       retorted another voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      With assurance slightly wobbling and a touch of the nasal whine, the first
      speaker protested, &ldquo;Well, look what George III done to us. Bad as any
      Kaiser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, get your facts straight!&rdquo; It was said with scornful force. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
      know George III was a German? Don&rsquo;t you know it was Hessians&mdash;they&rsquo;re
      Germans&mdash;he hired to come over here and kill Americans and do his
      dirty work for him? And his Germans did the same dirty work the Kaiser&rsquo;s
      are doing now. We&rsquo;ve got a letter written after the battle of Long Island
      by a member of our family they took prisoner there. And they stripped him
      and they stole his things and they beat him down with the butts of their
      guns&mdash;after he had surrendered, mind&mdash;when he was surrendered
      and naked, and when he was down they beat him some more. That&rsquo;s Germans
      for you. Only they&rsquo;ve been getting worse while the rest of the world&rsquo;s
      been getting better. Get your facts straight, man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A number of us were now listening to this, and I envied the historian his
      ingenious promptness&mdash;I have none&mdash;and I hoped for more of this
      timely debate. But debate was over. The anti-Englishman faded to silence.
      Either he was out of facts to get straight, or lacked what is so pithily
      termed &ldquo;come-back.&rdquo; The latter, I incline to think; for come-back needs no
      facts, it is a self-feeder, and its entire absence in the anti-Englishman
      looks as if he had been a German. Germans do not come back when it goes
      against them, they bleat &ldquo;Kamerad!&rdquo;&mdash;or disappear. Perhaps this man
      was a spy&mdash;a poor one, to be sure&mdash;yet doing his best for his
      Kaiser: slinking about, peeping, listening, trying to wedge the Allies
      apart, doing his little bit towards making friends enemies, just as his
      breed has worked to set enmity between ourselves and Japan, ourselves and
      Mexico, France and England, France and Italy, England and Russia, between
      everybody and everybody else all the world over, in the sacred name and
      for the sacred sake of the Kaiser. Thus has his breed, since we occupied
      Coblenz, run to the French soldiers with lies about us and then run to us
      with lies about the French soldiers, overlooking in its providential
      stupidity the fact that we and the French would inevitably compare notes.
      Thus too is his breed, at the moment I write these words, infesting and
      poisoning the earth with a propaganda that remains as coherent and as
      systematically directed as ever it was before the papers began to assure
      us that there was nothing left of the Hohenzollern government.

    <h2>
      Chapter IV: &ldquo;My Army of Spies&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will desire to know,&rdquo; said the Kaiser to his council at Potsdam in
      June, 1908, after the successful testing of the first Zeppelin, &ldquo;how the
      hostilities will be brought about. My army of spies scattered over Great
      Britain and France, as it is over North and South America, will take good
      care of that. Even now I rule supreme in the United States, where three
      million voters do my bidding at the Presidential elections.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, they did his bidding; there, and elsewhere too. They did it at other
      elections as well. Do you remember the mayor they tried to elect in
      Chicago? and certain members of Congress? and certain manufacturers and
      bankers? They did his bidding in our newspapers, our public schools, and
      from the pulpit. Certain localities in one of the river counties of Iowa
      (for instance) were spots of German treason to the United States. The
      &ldquo;exchange professors&rdquo; that came from Berlin to Harvard and other
      universities were so many camouflaged spies. Certain prominent American
      citizens, dined and wined and flattered by the Kaiser for his purpose,
      women as well as men, came back here mere Kaiser-puppets, hypnotized by
      royalty. His bidding was done in as many ways as would fill a book.
      Shopkeepers did it, servants did it, Americans among us were decorated by
      him for doing it. Even after the Armistice, a school textbook &ldquo;got by&rdquo; the
      Board of Education in a western state, wherein our boys and girls were to
      be taught a German version&mdash;a Kaiser version&mdash;of Germany.
      Somebody protested, and the board explained that it &ldquo;hadn&rsquo;t noticed,&rdquo; and
      the book was held up.
    </p>
    <p>
      We cannot, I fear, order the school histories in Germany to be edited by
      the Allies. German school children will grow up believing, in all
      prob-ability, that bombs were dropped near Nurnberg in July, 1914, that
      German soil was invaded, that the Fatherland fought a war of defense; they
      will certainly be nourished by lies in the future as they were nourished
      by lies in the past. But we can prevent Germans or pro-Germans writing our
      own school histories; we can prevent that &ldquo;army of spies&rdquo; of which the
      Kaiser boasted to his council at Potsdam in June, 1908, from continuing
      its activities among us now and henceforth; and we can prevent our school
      textbooks from playing into Germany&rsquo;s hand by teaching hate of England to
      our boys and girls. Beside the sickening silliness which still asks, &ldquo;What
      has England done in the war?&rdquo; is a silliness still more sickening which
      says, &ldquo;Germany is beaten. Let us forgive and forget.&rdquo; That is not
      Christianity. There is nothing Christian about it. It is merely
      sentimental slush, sloppy shirking of anything that compels national
      alertness, or effort, or self-discipline, or self-denial; a moral
      cowardice that pushes away any fact which disturbs a shallow, torpid,
      irresponsible, self-indulgent optimism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our golden age of isolation is over. To attempt to return to it would be a
      mere pernicious day-dream. To hark back to Washington&rsquo;s warning against
      entangling alliances is as sensible as to go by a map of the world made in
      1796. We are coupled to the company of nations like a car in the middle of
      a train, only more inevitably and permanently, for we cannot uncouple; and
      if we tried to do so, we might not wreck the train, but we should
      assuredly wreck ourselves. I think the war has brought us one benefit
      certainly: that many young men return from Europe knowing this, who had no
      idea of it before they went, and who know also that Germany is at heart an
      untamed, unchanged wild beast, never to be trusted again. We must not, and
      shall not, boycott her in trade; but let us not go to sleep at the switch!
      Just as busily as she is baking pottery opposite Coblenz, labelled &ldquo;made
      in St. Louis,&rdquo; &ldquo;made in Kansas City,&rdquo; her &ldquo;army of spies&rdquo; is at work here
      and everywhere to undermine those nations who have for the moment delayed
      her plans for world dominion. I think the number of Americans who know
      this has increased; but no American, wherever he lives, need travel far
      from home to meet fellow Americans who sing the song of slush about
      forgiving and forgetting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the man I heard talking in front of the bulletin board was one of
      the &ldquo;army of spies,&rdquo; as I like to infer from his absence of &ldquo;come-back.&rdquo;
       But perhaps he was merely an innocent American who at school had studied,
      for instance, Eggleston&rsquo;s history; thoughtless&mdash;but by no means
      harmless; for his school-taught &ldquo;slant&rdquo; against England, in the days we
      were living through then, amounted to a &ldquo;slant&rdquo; for Germany. He would be
      sorry if Germany beat France, but not if she beat England&mdash;when
      France and England were joined in keeping the wolf not only from their
      door but from ours! It matters not in the least that they were fighting
      our battle, not because they wanted to, but because they couldn&rsquo;t help it:
      they were fighting it just the same. That they were compelled doesn&rsquo;t
      matter, any more than it matters that in going to war when Belgium was
      invaded, England&rsquo;s duty and England&rsquo;s self-interest happened to coincide.
      Our duty and our interest also coincided when we entered the war and
      joined England and France. Have we seemed to think that this diminished
      our glory? Have they seemed to think that it absolved them from gratitude?
    </p>
    <p>
      Such talk as that man&rsquo;s in front of the bulletin board helped Germany
      then, whether he meant to or not, just as much as if a spy had said it&mdash;just
      as much as similar talk against England to-day, whether by spies or
      unheeding Americans, helps the Germany of to-morrow. The Germany of
      yesterday had her spies all over France and Italy, busily suggesting to
      rustic uninformed peasants that we had gone to France for conquest of
      France, and intended to keep some of her land. What is she telling them
      now? I don&rsquo;t know. Something to her advantage and their disadvantage, you
      may be sure, just as she is busy suggesting to us things to her advantage
      and our disadvantage&mdash;jealousy and fear of the British navy, or
      pro-German school histories for our children, or that we can&rsquo;t make dyes,
      or whatever you please: the only sure thing is, that the Germany of
      yesterday is the Germany of to-morrow. She is not changed. She will not
      change. The steady stream of her propaganda all over the world proves it.
      No matter how often her masquerading government changes costumes, that
      costume is merely her device to conceal the same cunning, treacherous wild
      beast that in 1914, after forty years of preparation, sprang at the throat
      of the world. Of all the nations in the late war, she alone is pulling
      herself together. She is hard at work. She means to spring again just as
      soon as she can.

    <p>
      Did you read the letter written in April of 1919 by her Vice-Chancellor,
      Mathias Erzberger, also her minister of finance? A very able, compact
      masterpiece of malignant voracity, good enough to do credit to Satan.
      Through that lucky flaw of stupidity which runs through apparently every
      German brain, and to which we chiefly owe our victory and temporary
      respite from the fangs of the wolf, Mathias Erzberger posted his letter.
      It went wrong in the mails. If you desire to read the whole of it, the
      International News Bureau can either furnish it or put you on the track of
      it. One sentence from it shall be quoted here:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will undertake the restoration of Russia, and in possession of such
      support will be ready, within ten or fifteen years, to bring France,
      without any difficulty, into our power. The march towards Paris will be
      easier than in 1914. The last step but one towards the world dominion will
      then be reached. The continent is ours. Afterwards will follow the last
      stage, the closing struggle, between the continent and the over-seas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Who is meant by &ldquo;overseas&rdquo;? Is there left any honest American brain so
      fond and so feeble as to suppose that we are not included in that highly
      suggestive and significant term? I fear that some such brains are left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Germans remain German. I was talking with an American officer just
      returned from Coblenz. He described the surprise of the Germans when they
      saw our troops march in to occupy that region of their country. They said
      to him: &ldquo;But this is extraordinary. Where do these soldiers of yours come
      from? You have only 150,000 troops in Europe. All the other transports
      were sunk by our submarines.&rdquo; &ldquo;We have two million troops in Europe,&rdquo;
       replied the officer, &ldquo;and lost by explosion a very few hundred. No
      transport was sunk.&rdquo; &ldquo;But that is impossible,&rdquo; returned the burgher, &ldquo;we
      know from our Government at Berlin that you have only 150,000 troops in
      Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Germans remain German. At Coblenz they were servile, cringing, fawning,
      ready to lick the boots of the Americans, loading them with offers of
      every food and drink and joy they had. Thus they began. Soon, finding that
      the Americans did not cut their throats, burn their houses, rape their
      daughters, or bayonet their babies, but were quiet, civil, disciplined,
      and apparently harmless, they changed. Their fawning faded away, they
      scowled and muttered. One day the Burgomaster at a certain place replied
      to some ordinary requisitions with an arrogant refusal. It was quite out
      of the question, he said, to comply with any such ridiculous demands. Then
      the Americans ceased to seem harmless. Certain steps were taken by the
      commanding officer, some leading citizens were collected and enlightened
      through the only channel whereby light penetrates a German skull. Thus, by
      a very slight taste of the methods by which they thought they would cow
      the rest of the world, these burghers were cowed instantly. They had
      thought the Americans afraid of them. They had taken civility for fear.
      Suddenly they encountered what we call the swift kick. It educated them.
      It always will. Nothing else will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mathias Erzberger will, of course, disclaim his letter. He will say it is
      a forgery. He will point to the protestations of German repentance and
      reform with which he sweated during April, 1919, and throughout the weeks
      preceding the delivery of the Treaty at Versailles. Perhaps he has done
      this already. All Germans will believe him&mdash;and some Americans.
    </p>
    <p>
      The German method, the German madness&mdash;what a mixture! The method
      just grazed making Germany owner of the earth, the madness saved the
      earth. With perfect recognition of Belgium&rsquo;s share, of Russia&rsquo;s share, of
      France&rsquo;s, Italy&rsquo;s, England&rsquo;s, our own, in winning the war, I believe that
      the greatest and mast efficient Ally of all who contributed to Germany&rsquo;s
      defeat was her own constant blundering madness. Americans must never
      forget either the one or the other, and too many are trying to forget
      both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Germans remain German. An American lady of my acquaintance was about to
      climb from Amalfi to Ravello in company with a German lady of her
      acquaintance. The German lady had a German Baedeker, the American a
      Baedeker in English, published several years apart. The Baedeker in German
      recommended a path that went straight up the ascent, the Baedeker in
      English a path that went up more gradually around it. &ldquo;Mine says this is
      the best way,&rdquo; said the American. &ldquo;Mine says straight up is the best,&rdquo;
       said the German. &ldquo;But mine is a later edition,&rdquo; said the American. &ldquo;That
      is not it,&rdquo; explained the German. &ldquo;It is that we Germans are so much more
      clever and agile, that to us is recommended the more dangerous way while
      Americans are shown the safe path.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That happened in 1910. That is Kultur. This too is Kultur:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

                 &ldquo;If Silesia become Polish
 Then, oh God, may children perish, like beasts, in their mothers&rsquo; womb.
 Then lame their Polish feet and their hands, oh God!
 Let them be crippled and blind their eyes.
 Smite them with dumbness and madness,both men and women.&rdquo;
 
                 From a Hymn of German hate for the Poles.
</pre>
    <p>
      Germany remains German; but when next she springs, she will make no
      blunders.

    <h2>
      Chapter V: The Ancient Grudge
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was in Broad Street, Philadelphia, before we went to war, that I
      overheard the foolish&mdash;or propagandist&mdash;slur upon England in
      front of the bulletin board. After we were fighting by England&rsquo;s side for
      our existence, you might have supposed such talk would cease. It did not.
      And after the Armistice, it continued. On the day we celebrated as
      &ldquo;British Day,&rdquo; a man went through the crowd in Wanamaker&rsquo;s shop, asking,
      What had England done in the War, anyhow? Was he a German, or an Irishman,
      or an American in pay of Berlin? I do not know. But this I know: perfectly
      good Americans still talk like that. Cowboys in camp do it. Men and women
      in Eastern cities, persons with at least the external trappings of
      educated intelligence, play into the hands of the Germany of to-morrow, do
      their unconscious little bit of harm to the future of freedom and
      civilization, by repeating that England &ldquo;has always been our enemy.&rdquo; Then
      they mention the Revolution, the War of 1812, and England&rsquo;s attitude
      during our Civil War, just as they invariably mentioned these things in
      1917 and 1918, when England was our ally in a struggle (or life, and as
      they will be mentioning them in 1940, I presume, if they are still alive
      at that time).
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the Civil War ended fifty-five years ago, the War of 1812 one hundred
      and five, and the Revolution one hundred and thirty-seven. Suppose, while
      the Kaiser was butchering Belgium because she barred his way to that
      dinner he was going to eat in Paris in October, 1914, that France had
      said, &ldquo;England is my hereditary enemy. Henry the Fifth and the Duke of
      Wellington and sundry Plantagenets fought me&rdquo;; and suppose England had
      said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care much for France. Joan of Arc and Napoleon and sundry
      other French fought me&rdquo;&mdash;suppose they had sat nursing their ancient
      grudges like that? Well, the Kaiser would have dined in Paris according to
      his plan. And next, according to his plan, with the Channel ports taken he
      would have dined in London. And finally, according to his plan, and with
      the help of his &ldquo;army of spies&rdquo; overseas, he would have dined in New York
      and the White House. For German madness could not have defeated Germany&rsquo;s
      plan of World dominion, if various nations had not got together and
      assisted. Other Americans there are, who do not resort to the Revolution
      for their grudge, but are in a commercial rage over this or that: wool,
      for instance. Let such Americans reflect that commercial grievances
      against England can be more readily adjusted than an absorption of all
      commerce by Germany can be adjusted. Wool and everything else will belong
      to Mathias Erzberger and his breed, if they carry out their intention. And
      the way to insure their carrying it out is to let them split us and
      England and all their competitors asunder by their ceaseless and ingenious
      propaganda, which plays upon every international prejudice, historic,
      commercial, or other, which is available. After August, 1914, England
      barred the Kaiser&rsquo;s way to New York, and in 1917, we found it useful to
      forget about George the Third and the Alabama. In 1853 Prussia possessed
      one ship of war&mdash;her first.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1918 her submarines were prowling along our coast. For the moment they
      are no longer there. For a while they may not be. But do you think Germany
      intends that scraps of paper shall be abolished by any Treaty, even though
      it contain 80,000 words and a League of Nations? She will make of that
      Treaty a whole basket of scraps, if she can, and as soon as she can. She
      has said so. Her workingmen are at work, industrious and content with a
      quarter the pay for a longer day than anywhere else. Let those persons who
      cannot get over George the Third and the Alabama ponder upon this for a
      minute or two.

    <h2>
      Chapter VI: Who Is Without Sin?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Much else is there that it were well they should ponder, and I am coming
      to it presently; but first, one suggestion. Most of us, if we dig back
      only fifty or sixty or seventy years, can disinter various relatives over
      whose doings we should prefer to glide lightly and in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you mean to say that you have none? Nobody stained with any shade of
      dishonor? No grandfather, great-grandfather, great-great-etc. grandfather
      or grandmother who ever made a scandal, broke a heart, or betrayed a
      trust? Every man Jack and woman Jill of the lot right back to Adam and Eve
      wholly good, honorable, and courageous? How fortunate to be sprung
      exclusively from the loins of centuries of angels&mdash;and to know all
      about them! Consider the hoard of virtue to which you have fallen heir!
    </p>
    <p>
      But you know very well that this is not so; that every one of us has every
      kind of person for an ancestor; that all sorts of virtue and vice, of
      heroism and disgrace, are mingled in our blood; that inevitably amidst the
      huge herd of our grandsires black sheep as well as white are to be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it is with men, so it is with nations. Do you imagine that any nation
      has a spotless history? Do you think that you can peer into our past, turn
      over the back pages of our record, and never come upon a single blot?
      Indeed you cannot. And it is better&mdash;a great deal better&mdash;that
      you should be aware of these blots. Such knowledge may enlighten you, may
      make you a better American. What we need is to be critics of ourselves,
      and this is exactly what we have been taught not to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are quite good enough to look straight at ourselves. Owing to one thing
      and another we are cleaner, honester, humaner, and whiter than any people
      on the continent of Europe. If any nation on the continent of Europe has
      ever behaved with the generosity and magnanimity that we have shown to
      Cuba, I have yet to learn of it. They jeered at us about Cuba, did the
      Europeans of the continent. Their papers stuck their tongues in their
      cheeks. Of course our fine sentiments were all sham, they said. Of course
      we intended to swallow Cuba, and never had intended anything else. And
      when General Leonard Wood came away from Cuba, having made Havana healthy,
      having brought order out of chaos on the island, and we left Cuba
      independent, Europe jeered on. That dear old Europe!
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, in 1909, it was not any European nation that returned to China
      their share of the indemnity exacted in consequence of the Boxer troubles;
      we alone returned our share to China&mdash;sixteen millions. It was we who
      prevented levying a punitive indemnity on China. Read the whole story;
      there is much more. We played the gentleman, Europe played the bully. But
      Europe calls us &ldquo;dollar chasers.&rdquo; That dear old Europe! Again, if any
      conquering General on the continent of Europe ever behaved as Grant did to
      Lee at Appomattox, his name has escaped me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, and lastly&mdash;though I am not attempting to tell you here the
      whole tale of our decencies: Whose hands came away cleanest from that
      Peace Conference in Paris lately? What did we ask for ourselves?
      Everything we asked, save some repairs of damage, was for other people.
      Oh, yes! we are quite good enough to keep quiet about these things. No
      need whatever to brag. Bragging, moreover, inclines the listener to
      suspect you&rsquo;re not so remarkable as you sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all this virtue doesn&rsquo;t in the least alter the fact that we&rsquo;re like
      everybody else in having some dirty pages in our History. These pages it
      is a foolish mistake to conceal. I suppose that the school histories of
      every nation are partly bad. I imagine that most of them implant the germ
      of international hatred in the boys and girls who have to study them.
      Nations do not like each other, never have liked each other; and it may
      very well be that school textbooks help this inclination to dislike.
      Certainly we know what contempt and hatred for other nations the Germans
      have been sedulously taught in their schools, and how utterly they
      believed their teaching. How much better and wiser for the whole world if
      all the boys and girls in all the schools everywhere were henceforth to be
      started in life with a just and true notion of all flags and the peoples
      over whom they fly! The League of Nations might not then rest upon the
      quicksand of distrust and antagonism which it rests upon today. But it is
      our own school histories that are my present concern, and I repeat my
      opinion&mdash;or rather my conviction&mdash;that the way in which they
      have concealed the truth from us is worse than silly, it is harmful. I am
      not going to take up the whole list of their misrepresentations, I will
      put but one or two questions to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you finished school, what idea had you about the War of 1812? I will
      tell you what mine was. I thought we had gone to war because England was
      stopping American ships and taking American sailors out of them for her
      own service. I could refer to Perry&rsquo;s victory on Lake Erie and Jackson&rsquo;s
      smashing of the British at New Orleans; the name of the frigate
      Constitution sent thrills through me. And we had pounded old John Bull and
      sent him to the right about a second time! Such was my glorious idea, and
      there it stopped. Did you know much more than that about it when your
      schooling was done? Did you know that our reasons for declaring war
      against Great Britain in 1812 were not so strong as they had been three
      and four years earlier? That during those years England had moderated her
      arrogance, was ready to moderate further, had placated us for her brutal
      performance concerning the Chesapeake, wanted peace; while we, who had
      been nearly unanimous for war, and with a fuller purse in 1808, were now,
      by our own congressional fuddling and messing, without any adequate army,
      and so divided in counsel that only one northern state was wholly in favor
      of war? Did you know that our General Hull began by invading Canada from
      Detroit and surrendered his whole army without firing a shot? That the
      British overran Michigan and parts of Ohio, and western New York, while we
      retreated disgracefully? That though we shone in victories of single
      combat on the sea and showed the English that we too knew how to sail and
      fight on the waves as hardily as Britannia (we won eleven out of thirteen
      of the frigate and sloop actions), nevertheless she caught us or blocked
      us up, and rioted unchecked along our coasts? You probably did know that
      the British burned Washington, and you accordingly hated them for this
      barbarous vandalism&mdash;but did you know that we had burned Toronto a
      year earlier?
    </p>
    <p>
      I left school knowing none of this&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t in my school book, and
      I learned it in mature years with amazement. I then learned also that
      England, while she was fighting with us, had her hands full fighting
      Bonaparte, that her war with us was a sideshow, and that this was
      uncommonly lucky for us&mdash;as lucky quite as those ships from France
      under Admiral de Grasse, without whose help Washington could never have
      caught Cornwallis and compelled his surrender at Yorktown, October 19,
      1781. Did you know that there were more French soldiers and sailors than
      Americans at Yorktown? Is it well to keep these things from the young? I
      have not done with the War of 1812. There is a political aspect of it that
      I shall later touch upon&mdash;something that my school books never
      mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      My next question is, what did you know about the Mexican War of 1846-1847,
      when you came out of school? The names of our victories, I presume, and of
      Zachary Taylor and Winfield Scott; and possibly the treaty of Guadalupe
      Hidalgo, whereby Mexico ceded to us the whole of Texas, New Mexico, and
      Upper California, and we paid her fifteen millions. No doubt you know that
      Santa Anna, the Mexican General, had a wooden leg. Well, there is more to
      know than that, and I found it out much later. I found out that General
      Grant, who had fought with credit as a lieutenant in the Mexican War,
      briefly summarized it as &ldquo;iniquitous.&rdquo; I gradually, through my reading as
      a man, learned the truth about the Mexican War which had not been taught
      me as a boy&mdash;that in that war we bullied a weaker power, that we made
      her our victim, that the whole discreditable business had the extension of
      slavery at the bottom of it, and that more Americans were against it than
      had been against the War of 1812. But how many Americans ever learn these
      things? Do not most of them, upon leaving school, leave history also
      behind them, and become farmers, or merchants, or plumbers, or firemen, or
      carpenters, or whatever, and read little but the morning paper for the
      rest of their lives?
    </p>
    <p>
      The blackest page in our history would take a long while to read. Not a
      word of it did I ever see in my school textbooks. They were written on the
      plan that America could do no wrong. I repeat that, just as we love our
      friends in spite of their faults, and all the more intelligently because
      we know these faults, so our love of our country would be just as strong,
      and far more intelligent, were we honestly and wisely taught in our early
      years those acts and policies of hers wherein she fell below her lofty and
      humane ideals. Her character and her record on the whole from the
      beginning are fine enough to allow the shadows to throw the sunlight into
      relief. To have produced at three stages of our growth three such men as
      Washington, Lincoln, and Roosevelt, is quite sufficient justification for
      our existence

    <h2>
      Chapter VII: Tarred with the Same Stick
    </h2>
    <p>
      The blackest page in our history is our treatment of the Indian. To speak
      of it is a thankless task&mdash;thankless, and necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      This land was the Indian&rsquo;s house, not ours. He was here first, nobody
      knows how many centuries first. We arrived, and we shoved him, and shoved
      him, and shoved him, back, and back, and back. Treaty after treaty we made
      with him, and broke. We drew circles round his freedom, smaller and
      smaller. We allowed him such and such territory, then took it away and
      gave him less and worse in exchange. Throughout a century our promises to
      him were a whole basket of scraps of paper. The other day I saw some
      Indians in California. It had once been their place. All over that region
      they had hunted and fished and lived according to their desires, enjoying
      life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We came. To-day the hunting
      and fishing are restricted by our laws&mdash;not the Indian&rsquo;s&mdash;because
      we wasted and almost exterminated in a very short while what had amply
      provided the Indian with sport and food for a very long while.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that region we have taken, as usual, the fertile land and the running
      water, and have allotted land to the Indian where neither wood nor water
      exist, no crops will grow, no human life can be supported. I have seen the
      land. I have seen the Indian begging at the back door. Oh, yes, they were
      an &ldquo;inferior race.&rdquo; Oh, yes, they didn&rsquo;t and couldn&rsquo;t use the land to the
      best advantage, couldn&rsquo;t build Broadway and the Union Pacific Railroad,
      couldn&rsquo;t improve real estate. If you choose to call the whole thing
      &ldquo;manifest destiny,&rdquo; I am with you. I&rsquo;ll not dispute that what we have made
      this continent is of greater service to mankind than the wilderness of the
      Indian ever could possibly have been&mdash;once conceding, as you have to
      concede, the inevitableness of civilization. Neither you, nor I, nor any
      man, can remold the sorry scheme of things entire. But we could have
      behaved better to the Indian. That was in our power. And we gave him a raw
      deal instead, not once, but again and again. We did it because we could do
      it without risk, because he was weaker and we could always beat him in the
      end. And all the while we were doing it, there was our Bill of Rights, our
      Declaration of Independence, founded on a new thing in the world,
      proclaiming to mankind the fairest hope yet born, that &ldquo;All men are
      endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights,&rdquo; and that these
      were now to be protected by law. Ah, no, look at it as you will, it is a
      black page, a raw deal. The officers of our frontier army know all about
      it, because they saw it happen. They saw the treaties broken, the thieving
      agents, the trespassing settlers, the outrages that goaded the deceived
      Indian to despair and violence, and when they were ordered out to kill
      him, they knew that he had struck in self-defense and was the real victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is too late to do much about it now. The good people of the Indian
      Rights Association try to do something; but in spite of them, what little
      harm can still be done is being done through dishonest Indian agents and
      the mean machinery of politics. If you care to know more of the long, bad
      story, there is a book by Helen Hunt Jackson, A Century of Dishonor; it is
      not new. It assembles and sets forth what had been perpetrated up to the
      time when it was written. A second volume could be added now.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have dwelt upon this matter here for a very definite reason, closely
      connected with my main purpose. It&rsquo;s a favorite trick of our anti-British
      friends to call England a &ldquo;land-grabber.&rdquo; The way in which England has
      grabbed land right along, all over the world, is monstrous, they say.
      England has stolen what belonged to whites, and blacks, and bronzes, and
      yellows, wherever she could lay her hands upon it, they say. England is a
      criminal. They repeat this with great satisfaction, this land-grabbing
      indictment. Most of them know little or nothing of the facts, couldn&rsquo;t
      tell you the history of a single case. But what are the facts to the man
      who asks, &ldquo;What has England done in this war, anyway?&rdquo; The word
      &ldquo;land-grabber&rdquo; has been passed to him by German and Sinn Fein propaganda,
      and he merely parrots it forth. He couldn&rsquo;t discuss it at all. &ldquo;Look at
      the Boers,&rdquo; he may know enough to reply, if you remind him that England&rsquo;s
      land-grabbing was done a good while ago. Well, we shall certainly look at
      the Boers in due time, but just now we must look at ourselves. I suppose
      that the American who denounces England for her land-grabbing has
      forgotten, or else has never known, how we grabbed Florida from Spain. The
      pittance that we paid Spain in one of the Florida transactions never went
      to her. The story is a plain tale of land-grabbing; and there are several
      other plain tales that show us to have been land-grabbers, if you will
      read the facts with an honest mind. I shall not tell them here. The case
      of the Indian is enough in the way of an instance. Our own hands are by no
      means clean. It is not for us to denounce England as a land-grabber.
    </p>
    <p>
      You cannot hate statistics more than I do. But at times there is no
      dodging them, and this is one of the times. In 1803 we paid Napoleon
      Bonaparte fifteen millions for what was then called Louisiana. Napoleon
      had his title to this land from Spain. Spain had it from France. France
      had it&mdash;how? She had it because La Salle, a Frenchman, sailed down
      the Mississippi River. This gave him title to the land. There were people
      on the bank already, long before La Salle came by.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would have surprised them to be told that the land was no longer theirs
      because a man had come by on the water. But nobody did tell them. They
      were Indians. They had wives and children and wigwams and other
      possessions in the land where they had always lived; but they were red,
      and the man in the boat was white, and therefore they were turned into
      trespassers because he had sailed by in a boat. That was the title to
      Louisiana which we bought from Napoleon Bonaparte.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Louisiana Purchase was a piece of land running up the Mississippi, up
      the Missouri, over the Divide, and down the Columbia to the Pacific.
      Before we acquired it, our area was over a quarter, but not half, a
      million square miles. This added nearly a million square miles more. But
      what had we really bought? Nothing but stolen goods. The Indians were
      there before La Salle, from whose boat-sailing the title we bought was
      derived. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; you may object, &ldquo;when whites rob reds or blacks, we call
      it Discovery; land-grabbing is when whites rob whites&mdash;and that is
      where I blame England.&rdquo; For the sake of argument I concede this, and refer
      you to our acquisition of Texas. This operation followed some years after
      the Florida operation. &ldquo;By request&rdquo; we &ldquo;annexed&rdquo; most of present Texas&mdash;in
      1845. That was a trick of our slaveholders. They sent people into Texas
      and these people swung the deal. It was virtually a theft from Mexico. A
      little while later, in 1848, we &ldquo;paid&rdquo; Mexico for California, Arizona, and
      Nevada. But if you read the true story of Fremont in California, and of
      the American plots there before the Mexican War, to undermine the
      government of a friendly nation, plots connived at in Washington with a
      view to getting California for ourselves, upon my word you will find it
      hard to talk of England being a land-grabber and keep a straight face.
      And, were a certain book to fall into your hands, the narrative of the
      Alcalde of Monterey, wherein he sets down what of Fremont&rsquo;s doings in
      California went on before his eyes, you would learn a story of treachery,
      brutality, and greed. All this acquisition of territory, together with the
      Gadsden Purchase a few years later, brought our continent to its present
      area&mdash;not counting Alaska or some islands later acquired&mdash;2,970,230
      square miles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please understand me very clearly: I am not saying that it has not been
      far better for the world and for civilization that we should have become
      the rulers of all this land, instead of its being ruled by the Indians or
      by Spain, or by Mexico. That is not at all the point. I am merely
      reminding you of the means whereby we got the land. We got it mostly by
      force and fraud, by driving out of it through firearms and plots people
      who certainly were there first and who were weaker than ourselves. Our
      reason was simply that we wanted it and intended to have it. That is
      precisely what England has done. She has by various means not one whit
      better or worse than ours, acquired her possessions in various parts of
      the world because they were necessary to her safety and welfare, just as
      this continent was necessary to our safety and welfare. Moreover, the
      pressure upon her, her necessity for self-preservation, was far more
      urgent than was the pressure upon us. To make you see this, I must once
      again resort to some statistics.
    </p>
    <p>
      England&rsquo;s area&mdash;herself and adjacent islands&mdash;is 120,832 square
      miles. Her population in 1811 was eighteen and one half millions. At that
      same time our area was 408,895 square miles, not counting the recent
      Louisiana Purchase. And our population was 7,239,881. With an area less
      than one third of ours (excluding the huge Louisiana) England had a
      population more than twice as great. Therefore she was more crowded than
      we were&mdash;how much more I leave you to figure out for yourself. I
      appeal to the fair-minded American reader who only &ldquo;wants to be shown,&rdquo;
       and I say to him, when some German or anti-British American talks to him
      about what a land-grabber England has been in her time to think of these
      things and to remember that our own past is tarred with the same stick.
      Let every one of us bear in mind that little sentence of the Kaiser&rsquo;s,
      &ldquo;Even now I rule supreme in the United States;&rdquo; let us remember that the
      Armistice and the Peace Treaty do not seem to have altered German nature
      or German plans very noticeably, and don&rsquo;t let us muddle our brains over
      the question of the land grabbed by the great-grandfathers of present
      England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any American who is anti-British to-day is by just so much pro-German, is
      helping the trouble of the world, is keeping discord alight, is doing his
      bit against human peace and human happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some other little sentences of the Kaiser and his Huns of which
      I shall speak before I finish: we must now take up the controversy of
      those men in front of the bulletin board; we must investigate what lies
      behind that controversy. Those two men are types. One had learned nothing
      since he left school, the other had.

    <h2>
      Chapter VIII: History Astigmatic
    </h2>
    <p>
      So far as I know, it was Mr. Sydney Gent Fisher, an American, who was the
      first to go back to the original documents, and to write from study of
      these documents the complete truth about England and ourselves during the
      Revolution. His admirable book tore off the cloak which our school
      histories had wrapped round the fables. He lays bare the political state
      of Britain at that time. What did you learn at your school of that
      political state? Did you ever wonder able General Howe and his manner of
      fighting us? Did it ever strike you that, although we were more often
      defeated than victorious in those engagements with him (and sometimes he
      even seemed to avoid pitched battles with us when the odds were all in his
      favor), yet somehow England did seem to reap the advantage she should be
      reaped from those contests, didn&rsquo;t follow them, let us get away, didn&rsquo;t in
      short make any progress to speak of in really conquering us? Perhaps you
      attributed this to our brave troops and our great Washington. Well, our
      troops were brave and Washington was great; but there was more behind&mdash;more
      than your school teaching ever led you to suspect, if your schooling was
      like mine. I imagined England as being just one whole unit of fury and
      tyranny directed against us and determined to stamp out the spark of
      liberty we had kindled. No such thing! England was violently divided in
      sentiment about us. Two parties, almost as opposed as our North and South
      have been&mdash;only it was not sectional in England&mdash;held very
      different views about liberty and the rights of Englishmen. The King&rsquo;s
      party, George the Third and his upholders, were fighting to saddle
      autocracy upon England; the other party, that of Pitt and Burke, were
      resisting this, and their sentiments and political beliefs led them to
      sympathize with our revolt against George III. &ldquo;I rejoice,&rdquo; writes Horace
      Walpole, Dec. 5, 1777, to the Countess of Upper Ossory, &ldquo;that the
      Americans are to be free, as they had a right to be, and as I am sure they
      have shown they deserve to be.... I own there are very able Englishmen
      left, but they happen to be on t&rsquo;other side of the Atlantic.&rdquo; It was
      through Whig influence that General Howe did not follow up his victories
      over us, because they didn&rsquo;t wish us to be conquered, they wished us to be
      able to vindicate the rights to which they held all Englishmen were
      entitled. These men considered us the champions of that British liberty
      which George III was attempting to crush. They disputed the rightfulness
      of the Stamp Act. When we refused to submit to the Stamp Tax in 1766, it
      was then that Pitt exclaimed in Parliament: &ldquo;I rejoice that America has
      resisted.... If ever this nation should have a tyrant for a King, six
      millions of freemen, so dead to all the feelings of liberty as voluntarily
      to submit to be slaves, would be fit instruments to make slaves of the
      rest.&rdquo; But they were not willing. When the hour struck and the war came,
      so many Englishmen were on our side that they would not enlist against us,
      refused to fight us, and George III had to go to Germany and obtain
      Hessians to help him out. His war against us was lost at home, on English
      soil, through English disapproval of his course, almost as much as it was
      lost here through the indomitable Washington and the help of France. That
      is the actual state of the case, there is the truth. Did you hear much
      about this at school? Did you ever learn there that George III had a fake
      Parliament, largely elected by fake votes, which did not represent the
      English people; that this fake Parliament was autocracy&rsquo;s last ditch in
      England; that it choked for a time the English democracy which, after the
      setback given it by the excesses of the French Revolution, went forward
      again until to-day the King of England has less power than the President
      of the United States? I suppose everybody in the world who knows the
      important steps of history knows this&mdash;except the average American.
      From him it has been concealed by his school histories; and generally he
      never learns anything about it at all, because once out of school, he
      seldom studies any history again. But why, you may possibly wonder, have
      our school histories done this? I think their various authors may
      consciously or unconsciously have felt that our case against England was
      not in truth very strong, that in fact she had been very easy with us, far
      easier than any other country was being with its colonies at that time.
      The King of France taxed his colonies, the King of Spain filled his purse,
      unhampered, from the pockets of Mexico and Peru and Cuba and Porto Rico&mdash;from
      whatever pocket into which he could put his hand, and the Dutch were doing
      the same without the slightest question of their right to do it. Our
      quarrel with the mother country and our breaking away from her in spite of
      the extremely light rein she was driving us with, rested in reality upon
      very slender justification. If ever our authors read of the meeting
      between Franklin, Rutledge, and Adams with General Howe, after the Battle
      of Long Island, I think they may have felt that we had almost no grievance
      at all. The plain truth of it was, we had been allowed for so long to be
      so nearly free that we determined to be free entirely, no matter what
      England conceded. Therefore these authors of our school textbooks felt
      that they needed to bolster our cause up for the benefit of the young.
      Accordingly our boys&rsquo; and girls&rsquo; sense of independence and patriotism must
      be nourished by making England out a far greater oppressor than ever she
      really had been. These historians dwelt as heavily as they could upon
      George III and his un-English autocracy, and as lightly as they could upon
      the English Pitt and upon all the English sympathy we had. Indeed, about
      this most of them didn&rsquo;t say a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that policy may possibly have been desirable once&mdash;if it can ever
      be desirable to suppress historic truth from a whole nation. But to-day,
      when we have long stood on our own powerful legs and need no bolstering up
      of such a kind, that policy is not only silly, it is pernicious. It is
      pernicious because the world is heaving with frightful menaces to all the
      good that man knows. They would strip life of every resource gathered
      through centuries of struggle. Mad mobs, whole races of people who have
      never thought at all, or who have now hurled away all pretense of thought,
      aim at mere destruction of everything that is. They don&rsquo;t attempt to offer
      any substitute. Down with religion, down with education, down with
      marriage, down with law, down with property: Such is their cry. Wipe the
      slate blank, they say, and then we&rsquo;ll see what we&rsquo;ll write on it. Amid
      this stands Germany with her unchanged purpose to own the earth; and Japan
      is doing some thinking. Amid this also is the Anglo-Saxon race, the race
      that has brought our law, our order, our safety, our freedom into the
      modern world. That any school histories should hinder the members of this
      race from understanding each other truly and being friends, should not be
      tolerated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many years later than Mr. Sydney George Fisher&rsquo;s analysis of England under
      George III, Mr. Charles Altschul has made an examination and given an
      analysis of a great number of those school textbooks wherein our boys and
      girls have been and are still being taught a history of our Revolution in
      the distorted form that I have briefly summarized. His book was published
      in 1917, by the George H. Doran Company, New York, and is entitled The
      American Revolution in our School Textbooks. Here following are some of
      his discoveries:
    </p>
    <p>
      Of forty school histories used twenty years ago in sixty-eight cities, and
      in many more unreported, four tell the truth about King George&rsquo;s pocket
      Parliament, and thirty-two suppress it. To-day our books are not quite so
      bad, but it is not very much better; and-to-day, be it added, any
      reforming of these textbooks by Boards of Education is likely to be
      prevented, wherever obstruction is possible, by every influence visible
      and invisible that pro-German and pro-Irish propaganda can exert.
      Thousands of our American school children all over our country are still
      being given a version of our Revolution and the political state of England
      then, which is as faulty as was George III&rsquo;s government, with its fake
      parliament, its &ldquo;rotten boroughs,&rdquo; its Little Sarum. Meanwhile that &ldquo;army
      of spies&rdquo; through which the Kaiser boasted that he ruled &ldquo;supreme&rdquo; here,
      and which, though he is gone, is by no means a demobilized army, but a
      very busy and well-drilled and well-conducted army, is very glad that our
      boys and girls should be taught false history, and will do its best to see
      that they are not taught true history.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Charles Altschul, in his admirable enterprise, addressed himself to
      those who preside over our school world all over the country; he received
      answers from every state in the Union, and he examined ninety-three
      history textbooks in those passages and pages which they devoted to our
      Revolution. These books he grouped according to the amount of information
      they gave about Pitt and Burke and English sympathy with us in our quarrel
      with George III. These groups are five in number, and dwindle down from
      group one, &ldquo;Textbooks which deal fully with the grievances of the
      colonists, give an account of general political conditions in England
      prior to the American Revolution, and give credit to prominent Englishmen
      for the services they rendered the Americans,&rdquo; to group five, &ldquo;Textbooks
      which deal fully with the grievances of the colonists, make no reference
      to general political conditions in England prior to the American
      Revolution, nor to any prominent Englishmen who devoted themselves to the
      cause of the Americans.&rdquo; Of course, what dwindles is the amount said about
      our English sympathizers. In groups three and four this is so scanty as to
      distort the truth and send any boy or girl who studied books of these
      groups out of school into life with a very imperfect idea indeed of the
      size and importance of English opposition to the policy of George III; in
      group five nothing is said about this at all. The boys and girls who
      studied books in group five would grow up believing that England was
      undividedly autocratic, tyrannical, and hostile to our liberty. In his
      careful and conscientious classification, Mr. Altschul gives us the books
      in use twenty years ago (and hence responsible for the opinion of
      Americans now between thirty and forty years old) and books in use to-day,
      and hence responsible for the opinion of those American men and women who
      will presently be grown up and will prolong for another generation the
      school-taught ignorance and prejudice of their fathers and mothers. I
      select from Mr. Altschul&rsquo;s catalogue only those books in use in 1917, when
      he published his volume, and of these only group five, where the facts
      about English sympathy with us are totally suppressed. Barnes&rsquo; School
      History of the United States, by Steele. Chandler and Chitword&rsquo;s Makers of
      American History. Chambers&rsquo; (Hansell&rsquo;s) A School History of the United
      States. Eggleston&rsquo;s A First Book in American History. Eggleston&rsquo;s History
      of the United States and Its People. Eg-gleston&rsquo;s New Century History of
      the United States. Evans&rsquo; First Lessons in Georgia History. Evans&rsquo; The
      Essential Facts of American History. Estill&rsquo;s Beginner&rsquo;s History of Our
      Country. Forman&rsquo;s History of the United States. Montgomery&rsquo;s An Elementary
      American History. Montgomery&rsquo;s The Beginner&rsquo;s American History. White&rsquo;s
      Beginner&rsquo;s History of the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the reader has followed me from the beginning, he will recollect a
      letter, parts of which I quoted, from a correspondent who spoke of
      Montgomery&rsquo;s history, giving passages in which a fair and adequate
      recognition of Pitt and our English sympathizers and their opposition to
      George III is made. This would seem to indicate a revision of the work
      since Mr. Altschul published his lists, and to substantiate the hope I
      expressed in my original article, and which I here repeat. Surely the
      publishers of these books will revise them! Surely any patriotic American
      publisher and any patriotic board of education, school principal, or
      educator, will watch and resist all propaganda and other sinister
      influence tending to perpetuate this error of these school histories!
      Whatever excuse they once had, be it the explanation I have offered above,
      or some other, there is no excuse to-day. These books have laid the
      foundation from which has sprung the popular prejudice against England. It
      has descended from father to son. It has been further solidified by many
      tales for boys and girls, written by men and women who acquired their
      inaccurate knowledge at our schools. And it plays straight into the hands
      of our enemies.

      All of these books, history and fiction, drop into the American mind
      during its early springtime the seed of antagonism, establish in fact an
      anti-English &ldquo;complex.&rdquo; It is as pretty a case of complex on the wholesale
      as could well be found by either historian or psychologist. It is not so
      violent as the complex which has been planted in the German people by
      forty years of very adroitly and carefully planned training: they were
      taught to distrust and hate everybody and to consider themselves so
      superior to anybody that their sacred duty as they saw it in 1914 was to
      enslave the world in order to force upon the world the priceless benefits
      of their Kultur. Under the shock of war that complex dilated into a form
      of real hysteria or insanity. Our anti-English com-plex is fortunately
      milder than that; but none the less does it savor slightly, as any nerve
      specialist or psychological doctor would tell you&mdash;-it savors
      slightly of hysteria, that hundreds of thousands of American men and women
      of every grade of education and ignorance should automatically exclaim
      whenever the right button is pressed, &ldquo;England is a land-grabber,&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;What has England done in the War?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word complex has been in our dictionary for a long while. This
      familiar adjective has been made by certain scientific people into a noun,
      and for brevity and convenience employed to denote something that almost
      all of us harbor in some form or other. These complexes, these lumps of
      ideas or impressions that match each other, that are of the same pattern,
      and that are also invariably tinctured with either a pleasurable or
      painful emotion, lie buried in our minds, unthought-of but alive, and lurk
      always ready to set up a ferment, whenever some new thing from outside
      that matches them enters the mind and hence starts them off. The
      &ldquo;suppressed complex&rdquo; I need not describe, as our English complex is by no
      means suppressed. Known to us all, probably, is the political complex.
      Year after year we have been excited about elections and candidates and
      policies, preferring one party to the other. If this preference has been
      very marked, or even violent, you know how disinclined we are to give
      credit to the other party for any act or policy, no matter how excellent
      in itself, which, had our own party been its sponsor, we should have been
      heart and soul for. You know how easily we forget the good deeds of the
      opposite party and how easily we remember its bad deeds. That&rsquo;s a good
      simple ordinary example of a complex. Its workings can be discerned in the
      experience of us all. In our present discussion it is very much to the
      point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Established in the soft young minds of our school boys and girls by a
      series of reiterated statements about the tyranny and hostility of England
      towards us in the Revolution, statements which they have to remember and
      master by study from day to day, tinctured by the anxiety about the
      examination ahead, when the students must know them or fail, these
      incidents of school work being also tinctured by another emotion, that of
      patriotism, enthusiasm for Washington, for the Declaration of
      Independence, for Valley Forge&mdash;thus established in the regular way
      of all complexes, this anti-English complex is fed and watered by what we
      learn of the War of 1812, by what we learn of the Civil War of 1861, and
      by many lesser events in our history thus far. And just as a Republican
      will admit nothing good of a Democrat and a Democrat nothing good of a
      Republican because of the political complex, so does the great&mdash;the
      vast&mdash;majority of Americans automatically and easily remember
      everything against England and forget everything in her favor. Just try it
      any day you like. Ask any average American you are sitting next to in a
      train what he knows about England; and if he does remember anything and
      can tell it to you, it will be unfavorable nine times in ten. The mere
      word &ldquo;England&rdquo; starts his complex off, and out comes every fact it has
      seized that matches his school-implanted prejudice, just as it has
      rejected every fact that does not match it. There is absolutely no other
      way to explain the American habit of speaking ill of England and well of
      France. Several times in the past, France has been flagrantly hostile to
      us. But there was Lafayette, there was Rochambeau, and the great service
      France did us then against England. Hence from our school histories we
      have a pro-French complex. Under its workings we automatically remember
      every good turn France has done us and automatically forget the evil
      turns. Again try the experiment yourself. How many Americans do you think
      that you will find who can recall, or who even know when you recall to
      them the insolent and meddlesome Citizen Genet, envoy of the French
      Republic, and how Washington requested his recall? Or the French
      privateers that a little later, about 1797-98, preyed upon our commerce?
      And the hatred of France which many Americans felt and expressed at that
      time? How many remember that the King of France, directly our Revolution
      was over, was more hostile to us than England?

    <h2>
      Chapter X: Jackstraws
    </h2>
    <p>
      Jackstraws is a game which most of us have played in our youth. You empty
      on a table a box of miniature toy rakes, shovels, picks, axes, all sorts
      of tools and implements. These lie under each other and above each other
      in intricate confusion, not unlike cross timber in a western forest, only
      instead of being logs, they are about two inches long and very light. The
      players sit round the table and with little hooks try in turn to lift one
      jackstraw out of the heap, without moving any of the others. You go on
      until you do move one of the others, and this loses you your turn.
      European diplomacy at any moment of any year reminds you, if you inspect
      it closely, of a game of jackstraws. Every sort and shape of intrigue is
      in the general heap and tangle, and the jealous nations sit round, each
      trying to lift out its own jackstraw. Luckily for us, we have not often
      been involved in these games of jackstraw hitherto; unluckily for us, we
      must be henceforth involved. If we kept out, our luck would be still
      worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately after our Revolution, there was one of these heaps of
      intrigue, in which we were concerned. This was at the time of the
      negotiations leading to the Treaty of Paris, to which I made reference at
      the close of the last section. This was in 1783. Twenty years later, in
      1803, occurred the heap of jackstraws that led to the Louisiana Purchase.
      Twenty years later, in 1823, occurred the heap of jackstraws from which
      emerged the Monroe Doctrine. Each of these dates, dotted along through our
      early decades, marks a very important crisis in our history. It is well
      that they should be grouped together, because together they disclose, so
      to speak, a coherent pattern. This coherent pattern is England&rsquo;s attitude
      towards ourselves. It is to be perceived, faintly yet distinctly, in 1783,
      and it grows clearer and ever more clear until in 1898, in the game of
      jackstraws played when we declared war upon Spain, the pattern is so clear
      that it could not be mistaken by any one who was not willfully blinded by
      an anti-English complex. This pattern represents a preference on England&rsquo;s
      part for ourselves to other nations. I do not ask you to think England&rsquo;s
      reason for this preference is that she has loved us so much; that she has
      loved others so much less&mdash;there is her reason. She has loved herself
      better than anybody. So must every nation. So does every nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me briefly speak of the first game of jackstraws, played at Paris in
      1783. Our Revolution was over. The terms of peace had to be drawn.
      Franklin, Jay, Adams, and Laurens were our negotiators. The various
      important points were acknowledgment of our independence, settlement of
      boundaries, freedom of fishing in the neighborhood of the Canadian coast.
      We had agreed to reach no settlement with England separately from France
      and Spain. They were our recent friends. England, our recent enemy, sent
      Richard Oswald as her peace commissioner. This private gentleman had
      placed his fortune at our disposal during the war, and was Franklin&rsquo;s
      friend. Lord Shelburne wrote Franklin that if this was not satisfactory,
      to say so, and name any one he preferred. But Oswald was satisfactory; and
      David Hartley, another friend of Franklin&rsquo;s and also a sympathizer with
      our Revolution, was added; and in these circumstances and by these men the
      Treaty was made. To France we broke our promise to reach no separate
      agreement with England. We negotiated directly with the British, and the
      Articles were signed without consultation with the French Government. When
      Vergennes, the French Minister, saw the terms, he remarked in disgust that
      England would seem to have bought a peace rather than made one. By the
      treaty we got the Northwest Territory and the basin of the Ohio River to
      the Mississippi. Our recent friend, the French King, was much opposed to
      our having so much territory. It was our recent enemy, England, who agreed
      that we should have it. This was the result of that game of jackstraws.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us remember several things: in our Revolution, France had befriended
      us, not because she loved us so much, but because she loved England so
      little. In the Treaty of Paris, England stood with us, not because she
      loved us so much, but because she loved France so little. We must cherish
      no illusions. Every nation must love itself more than it loves its
      neighbor. Nevertheless, in this pattern of England&rsquo;s policy in 1783, where
      she takes her stand with us and against other nations, there is a deep
      significance. Our notions of law, our notions of life, our notions of
      religion, our notions of liberty, our notions of what a man should be and
      what a woman should be, are so much more akin to her notions than to those
      of any other nation, that they draw her toward us rather than toward any
      other nation. That is the lesson of the first game of jackstraws.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next comes 1803. Upon the Louisiana Purchase, I have already touched; but
      not upon its diplomatic side. In those years the European game of
      diplomacy was truly portentous. Bonaparte had appeared, and Bonaparte was
      the storm centre. From the heap of jackstraws I shall lift out only that
      which directly concerns us and our acquisition of that enormous territory,
      then called Louisiana. Bonaparte had dreamed and planned an empire over
      here. Certain vicissitudes disenchanted him. A plan to invade England also
      helped to deflect his mind from establishing an outpost of his empire upon
      our continent. For us he had no love. Our principles were democratic, he
      was a colossal autocrat. He called us &ldquo;the reign of chatter,&rdquo; and he would
      have liked dearly to put out our light. Addington was then the British
      Prime Minister. Robert R. Livingston was our minister in Paris. In the
      history of Henry Adams, in Volume II at pages 52 and 53, you may find more
      concerning Bonaparte&rsquo;s dislike of the United States. You may also find
      that Talleyrand expressed the view that socially and economically England
      and America were one and indivisible. In Volume I of the same history, at
      page 439, you will see the mention which Pichon made to Talleyrand of the
      overtures which England was incessantly making to us. At some time during
      all this, rumor got abroad of Bonaparte&rsquo;s projects regarding Louisiana. In
      the second volume of Henry Adams, at pages 23 and 24, you will find
      Addington remarking to our minister to Great Britain, Rufus King, that it
      would not do to let Bonaparte establish himself in Louisiana. Addington
      very plainly hints that Great Britain would back us in any such event.
      This backing of us by Great Britain found very cordial acceptance in the
      mind of Thomas Jefferson. A year before the Louisiana Purchase was
      consummated, and when the threat of Bonaparte was in the air, Thomas
      Jefferson wrote to Livingston, on April 18, 1802, that &ldquo;the day France
      takes possession of New Orleans, we must marry ourselves to the British
      fleet and nation.&rdquo; In one of his many memoranda to Talleyrand, Livingston
      alludes to the British fleet. He also points out that France may by taking
      a certain course estrange the United States for ever and bind it closely
      to France&rsquo;s great enemy. This particular address to Talleyrand is dated
      February 1, 1803, and may be found in the Annals of Congress, 1802-1803,
      at pages 1078 to 1083. I quote a sentence: &ldquo;The critical moment has
      arrived which rivets the connexion of the United States to France, or
      binds a young and growing people for ages hereafter to her mortal and
      inveterate enemy.&rdquo; After this, hints follow concerning the relative
      maritime power of France and Great Britain. Livingston suggests that if
      Great Britain invade Louisiana, who can oppose her? Once more he refers to
      Great Britain&rsquo;s superior fleet. This interesting address concludes with
      the following exordium to France: &ldquo;She will cheaply purchase the esteem of
      men and the favor of Heaven by the surrender of a distant wilderness,
      which can neither add to her wealth nor to her strength.&rdquo; This, as you
      will perceive, is quite a pointed remark. Throughout the Louisiana
      diplomacy, and negotiations to which this diplomacy led, Livingston&rsquo;s
      would seem to be the master American mind and prophetic vision. But I must
      keep to my jackstraws. On April 17, 1803, Bonaparte&rsquo;s brother, Lucien,
      reports a conversation held with him by Bonaparte. What purposes, what
      oscillations, may have been going on deep in Bonaparte&rsquo;s secret mind, no
      one can tell. We may guess that he did not relinquish his plan about
      Louisiana definitely for some time after the thought had dawned upon him
      that it would be better if he did relinquish it. But unless he was lying
      to his brother Lucien on April 17, 1803, we get no mere glimpse, but a
      perfectly clear sight of what he had come finally to think. It was
      certainly worth while, he said to Lucien, to sell when you could what you
      were certain to lose; &ldquo;for the English... are aching for a chance to
      capture it.... Our navy, so inferior to our neighbor&rsquo;s across the Channel,
      will always cause our colonies to be exposed to great risks.... As to the
      sea, my dear fellow, you must know that there we have to lower the
      flag.... The English navy is, and long will be, too dominant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was on April 17. On May 2, the Treaty of Cession was signed by the
      exultant Livingston. Bonaparte, instead of establishing an outpost of
      autocracy at New Orleans, sold to us not only the small piece of land
      which we had originally in mind, but the huge piece of land whose
      dimensions I have given above. We paid him fifteen millions for nearly a
      million square miles. The formal transfer was made on December 17 of that
      same year, 1803. There is my second jackstraw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, twenty years after the first time in 1783, Great Britain stood
      between us and the designs of another nation. To that other nation her
      fleet was the deciding obstacle. England did not love us so much, but she
      loved France so much less. For the same reasons which I have suggested
      before, self-interest, behind which lay her democratic kinship with our
      ideals, ranged her with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      To place my third jackstraw, which follows twenty years after the second,
      uninterruptedly in this group, I pass over for the moment our War of 1812.
      To that I will return after I have dealt with the third jackstraw, namely,
      the Monroe Doctrine. It was England that suggested the Monroe Doctrine to
      us. From the origin of this in the mind of Canning to its public
      announcement upon our side of the water, the pattern to which I have
      alluded is for the third time very clearly to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      How much did your school histories tell you about the Monroe Doctrine? I
      confess that my notion of it came to this: President Monroe informed the
      kings of Europe that they must keep away from this hemisphere. Whereupon
      the kings obeyed him and have remained obedient ever since. Of George
      Canning I knew nothing. Another large game of jackstraws was being played
      in Europe in 1823. Certain people there had formed the Holy Alliance.
      Among these, Prince Metternich the Austrian was undoubtedly the master
      mind. He saw that by England&rsquo;s victory at Waterloo a threat to all
      monarchical and dynastic systems of government had been created. He also
      saw that our steady growth was a part of the same threat. With this in
      mind, in 1822, he brought about the Holy Alliance. The first Article of
      the Holy Alliance reads: &ldquo;The high contracting Powers, being convinced
      that the system of representative government is as equally incompatible
      with the monarchical principle as the maxim of sovereignty of the people
      with the Divine right, engage mutually, in the most solemn manner, to use
      all their efforts to put an end to the system of representative
      governments, in whatever country it may exist in Europe, and to prevent
      its being introduced in those countries where it is not yet known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Behind these words lay a design, hardly veiled, not only against South
      America, but against ourselves. In a volume entitled With the Fathers, by
      John Bach McMaster, and also in the fifth volume of Mr. McMaster&rsquo;s
      history, chapter 41, you will find more amply what I abbreviate here.
      Canning understood the threat to us contained in the Holy Alliance. He
      made a suggestion to Richard Rush, our minister to England. The suggestion
      was of such moment, and the ultimate danger to us from the Holy Alliance
      was of such moment, that Rush made haste to put the matter into the hands
      of President Monroe. President Monroe likewise found the matter very
      grave, and he therefore consulted Thomas Jefferson. At that time Jefferson
      had retired from public life and was living quietly at his place in
      Virginia. That President Monroe&rsquo;s communication deeply stirred him is to
      be seen in his reply, written October 24, 1823. Jefferson says in part:
      &ldquo;The question presented by the letters you have sent me is the most
      momentous which has ever been offered to my contemplation since that of
      independence.... One nation most of all could disturb us.... She now
      offers to lead, aid and accompany us.... With her on our side we need not
      fear the whole world. With her, then, we should most seriously cherish a
      cordial friendship, and nothing would tend more to unite our affections
      than to be fighting once more, side by side, in the same cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus for the second time, Thomas Jefferson advises a friendship with Great
      Britain. He realizes as fully as did Bonaparte the power of her navy, and
      its value to us. It is striking and strange to find Thomas Jefferson, who
      wrote the Declaration of Independence in 1776, writing in 1823 about
      uniting our affections and about fighting once more side by side with
      England.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the revolt of the Spanish Colonies from Spain in South America, and
      Canning&rsquo;s fear that France might obtain dominion in America, which led him
      to make his suggestion to Rush. The gist of the suggestion was, that we
      should join with Great Britain in saying that both countries were opposed
      to any intervention by Europe in the western hemisphere. Over our
      announcement there was much delight in England. In the London Courier
      occurs a sentence, &ldquo;The South American Republics&mdash;protected by the
      two nations that possess the institutions and speak the language of
      freedom.&rdquo; In this fragment from the London Courier, the kinship at which I
      have hinted as being felt by England in 1783, and in 1803, is definitely
      expressed. From the Holy Alliance, from the general European diplomatic
      game, and from England&rsquo;s preference for us who spoke her language and
      thought her thoughts about liberty, law, what a man should be, what a
      woman should be, issued the Monroe Doctrine. And you will find that no
      matter what dynastic or ministerial interruptions have occurred to obscure
      this recognition of kinship with us and preference for us upon the part of
      the English people, such interruptions are always temporary and lie always
      upon the surface of English sentiment. Beneath the surface the recognition
      of kinship persists unchanged and invariably reasserts itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is my third jackstraw. Canning spoke to Rush, Rush consulted Monroe,
      Monroe consulted Jefferson, and Jefferson wrote what we have seen. That,
      stripped of every encumbering circumstance, is the story of the Monroe
      Doctrine. Ever since that day the Monroe Doctrine has rested upon the
      broad back of the British Navy. This has been no secret to our leading
      historians, our authoritative writers on diplomacy, and our educated and
      thinking public men. But they have not generally been eager to mention it;
      and as to our school textbooks, none that I studied mentioned it at all.

    <h2>
      Chapter XI: Some Family Scraps
    </h2>
    <p>
      Do not suppose because I am reminding you of these things and shall remind
      you of some more, that I am trying to make you hate France. I am only
      trying to persuade you to stop hating England. I wish to show you how much
      reason you have not to hate her, which your school histories pass lightly
      over, or pass wholly by. I want to make it plain that your anti-English
      complex and your pro-French complex entice your memory into retaining only
      evil about England and only good about France. That is why I pull out from
      the recorded, certified, and perfectly ascertainable past, these few large
      facts. They amply justify, as it seems to me, and as I think it must seem
      to any reader with an open mind, what I said about the pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must now touch upon the War of 1812. There is a political aspect of
      this war which casts upon it a light not generally shed by our school
      histories. Bonaparte is again the point. Nine years after our Louisiana
      Purchase from him, we declared war upon England. At that moment England
      was heavily absorbed in her struggle with Bonaparte. It is true that we
      had a genuine grievance against her. In searching for British sailors upon
      our ships, she impressed our own. This was our justification.
    </p>
    <p>
      We made a pretty lame showing, in spite of the victories of our frigates
      and sloops. Our one signal triumph on land came after the Treaty of Peace
      had been signed at Ghent. During the years of war, it was lucky for us
      that England had Bonaparte upon her hands. She could not give us much
      attention. She was battling with the great Autocrat. We, by declaring war
      upon her at such a time, played into Bonaparte&rsquo;s hands, and virtually, by
      embarrassing England, struck a blow on the side of autocracy and against
      our own political faith. It was a feeble blow, it did but slight harm. And
      regardless of it England struck Bonaparte down. His hope that we might
      damage and lessen the power of her fleet that he so much respected and
      feared, was not realized. We made the Treaty of Ghent. The impressing of
      sailors from our vessels was tacitly abandoned. The next time that people
      were removed from vessels, it was not England who removed them, it was we
      ourselves, who had declared war on England for doing so, we ourselves who
      removed them from Canadian vessels in the Behring Sea, and from the
      British ship Trent. These incidents we shall reach in their proper place.
      As a result of the War of 1812, some English felt justified in taking from
      us a large slice of land, but Wellington said, &ldquo;I think you have no right,
      from the state of the war, to demand any concession of territory from
      America.&rdquo; This is all that need be said about our War of 1812.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because I am trying to give only the large incidents, I have intentionally
      made but a mere allusion to Florida and our acquisition of that territory.
      It was a case again of England&rsquo;s siding with us against a third power,
      Spain, in this instance. I have also omitted any account of our
      acquisition of Texas, when England was not friendly&mdash;I am not sure
      why: probably because of the friction between us over Oregon. But certain
      other minor events there are, which do require a brief reference&mdash;the
      boundaries of Maine, of Oregon, the Isthmian Canal, Cleveland and
      Venezuela, Roosevelt and Alaska; and these disputes we shall now take up
      together, before we deal with the very large matter of our trouble with
      England during the Civil War. Chronologically, of course, Venezuela and
      Alaska fall after the Civil War; but they belong to the same class to
      which Maine and Oregon belong. Together, all of these incidents and
      controversies form a group in which the underlying permanence of British
      good-will towards us is distinctly to be discerned. Sometimes, as I have
      said before, British anger with us obscures the friendly sentiment. But
      this was on the surface, and it always passed. As usual, it is only the
      anger that has stuck in our minds. Of the outcome of these controversies
      and the British temperance and restraint which brought about such outcome
      the popular mind retains no impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boundary of Maine was found to be undefined to the extent of 12,000
      square miles. Both Maine and New Brunswick claimed this, of course. Maine
      took her coat off to fight, so did New Brunswick. Now, we backed Maine,
      and voted supplies and men to her. Not so England. More soberly, she said,
      &ldquo;Let us arbitrate.&rdquo; We agreed, it was done. By the umpire Maine was
      awarded more than half what she claimed. And then we disputed the umpire&rsquo;s
      decision on the ground he hadn&rsquo;t given us the whole thing! Does not this
      remind you of some of our baseball bad manners? It was settled later, and
      we got, differently located, about the original award.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did you learn in school about &ldquo;fifty-four forty, or fight&rdquo;? We were ready
      to take off our coat again. Or at least, that was the platform in 1844 on
      which President Polk was elected. At that time, what lay between the north
      line of California and the south line of Alaska, which then belonged to
      Russia, was called Oregon. We said it was ours. England disputed this.
      Each nation based its title on discovery. It wasn&rsquo;t really far from an
      even claim. So Polk was elected, which apparently meant war; his words
      were bellicose. We blustered rudely. Feeling ran high in England; but she
      didn&rsquo;t take off her coat. Her ambassador, Pakenham, stiff at first, unbent
      later. Under sundry missionary impulses, more Americans than British had
      recently settled along the Columbia River and in the Willamette Valley.
      People from Missouri followed. You may read of our impatient violence in
      Professor Dunning&rsquo;s book, The British Empire and the United States.
      Indeed, this volume tells at length everything I am telling you briefly
      about these boundary disputes. The settlers wished to be under our
      Government. Virtually upon their preference the matter was finally
      adjusted. England met us with a compromise, advantageous to us and
      reasonable for herself. Thus, again, was her conduct moderate and pacific.
      If you think that this was through fear of us, I can only leave you to our
      western blow-hards of 1845, or to your anti-British complex. What I see in
      it, is another sign of that fundamental sense of kinship, that persisting
      unwillingness to have a real scrap with us, that stares plainly out of our
      whole first century&mdash;the same feeling which prevented so many English
      from enlisting against us in the Revolution that George III was obliged to
      get Hessians.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nicaragua comes next. There again they were quite angry with us on top,
      but controlled in the end by the persisting disposition of kinship. They
      had land in Nicaragua with the idea of an Isthmian Canal. This we did not
      like. They thought we should mind our own business. But they agreed with
      us in the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty that both should build and run the canal.
      Vagueness about territory near by raised further trouble, and there we
      were in the right. England yielded. The years went on and we grew, until
      the time came when we decided that if there was to be any canal, no one
      but ourselves should have it. We asked to be let off the old treaty.
      England let us off, stipulating the canal should be unfortified, and an
      &ldquo;open door&rdquo; to all. Our representative agreed to this, much to our
      displeasure. Indeed, I do not think he should have agreed to it. Did
      England hold us to it? All this happened in the lifetime of many of us,
      and we know that she did not hold us to it. She gave us what we asked, and
      she did so because she felt its justice, and that it in no way menaced her
      with injury. All this began in 1850 and ended, as we know, in the time of
      Roosevelt.
    </p>
    <p>
      About 1887 our seal-fishing in the Behring Sea brought on an acute
      situation. Into the many and intricate details of this, I need not go; you
      can find them in any good encyclopedia, and also in Harper&rsquo;s Magazine for
      April, 1891, and in other places. Our fishing clashed with Canada&rsquo;s. We
      assumed jurisdiction over the whole of the sea, which is a third as big as
      the Mediterranean, on the quite fantastic ground that it was an inland
      sea. Ignoring the law that nobody has jurisdiction outside the three-mile
      limit from their shores, we seized Canadian vessels sixty miles from land.
      In fact, we did virtually what we had gone to war with England for doing
      in 1812. But England did not go to war. She asked for arbitration.
      Throughout this, our tone was raw and indiscreet, while hers was
      conspicuously the opposite; we had done an unwarrantable and high-handed
      thing; our claim that Behring Sea was an &ldquo;inclosed&rdquo; sea was abandoned; the
      arbitration went against us, and we paid damages for the Canadian vessels.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1895, in the course of a century&rsquo;s dispute over the boundary between
      Venezuela and British Guiana, Venezuela took prisoner some British
      subjects, and asked us to protect her from the consequences. Richard
      Olney, Grover Cleveland&rsquo;s Secretary of State, informed Lord Salisbury,
      Prime Minister of England, that &ldquo;in accordance with the Monroe Doctrine,
      the United States must insist on arbitration&rdquo;&mdash;that is, of the
      disputed boundary. It was an abrupt extension of the Monroe Doctrine. It
      was dictating to England the manner in which she should settle a
      difference with another country. Salisbury declined. On December 17th
      Cleveland announced to England that the Monroe Doctrine applied to every
      stage of our national Life, and that as Great Britain had for many years
      refused to submit the dispute to impartial arbitration, nothing remained
      to us but to accept the situation. Moreover, if the disputed territory was
      found to belong to Venezuela, it would be the duty of the United States to
      resist, by every means in its power, the aggressions of Great Britain.
      This was, in effect, an ultimatum. The stock market went to pieces. In
      general American opinion, war was coming. The situation was indeed grave.
      First, we owed the Monroe Doctrine&rsquo;s very existence to English backing.
      Second, the Doctrine itself had been a declaration against autocracy in
      the shape of the Holy Alliance, and England was not autocracy. Lastly, as
      a nation, Venezuela seldom conducted herself or her government on the
      steady plan of democracy. England was exasperated. And yet England
      yielded. It took a little time, but arbitration settled it in the end&mdash;at
      about the same time that we flatly declined to arbitrate our quarrel with
      Spain. History will not acquit us of groundless meddling and arrogance in
      this matter, while England comes out of it having again shown in the end
      both forbearance and good manners. Before another Venezuelan incident in
      1902, I take up a burning dispute of 1903.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Oregon had formerly been, so Alaska had later become, a grave source of
      friction between England and ourselves. Canada claimed boundaries in
      Alaska which we disputed. This had smouldered along through a number of
      years until the discovery of gold in the Klondike region fanned it to a
      somewhat menacing flame. In this instance, history is as unlikely to
      approve the conduct of the Canadians as to approve our bad manners towards
      them upon many other occasions. The matter came to a head in Roosevelt&rsquo;s
      first administration. You will find it all in the Life of John Hay by
      William R. Thayer, Volume II. A commission to settle the matter had
      dawdled and failed. Roosevelt was tired of delays. Commissioners again
      were appointed, three Americans, two Canadians, and Alverstone, Lord Chief
      Justice, to represent England. To his friend Justice Oliver Wendell
      Holmes, about to sail for an English holiday, Roosevelt wrote a private
      letter privately to be shown to Mr. Balfour, Mr. Chamberlain, and certain
      other Englishmen of mark. He said: &ldquo;The claim of the Canadians for access
      to deep water along any part of the Alaskan coast is just exactly as
      indefensible as if they should now suddenly claim the Island of
      Nantucket.&rdquo; Canada had objected to our Commissioners as being not
      &ldquo;impartial jurists of repute.&rdquo; As to this, Roosevelt&rsquo;s letter to Holmes
      ran on: &ldquo;I believe that no three men in the United States could be found
      who would be more anxious than our own delegates to do justice to the
      British claim on all points where there is even a color of right on the
      British side. But the objection raised by certain British authorities to
      Lodge, Root, and Turner, especially to Lodge and Root, was that they had
      committed themselves on the general proposition. No man in public life in
      any position of prominence could have possibly avoided committing himself
      on the proposition, any more than Mr. Chamberlain could avoid committing
      himself on the ownership of the Orkneys if some Scandinavian country
      suddenly claimed them. If this embodied other points to which there was
      legitimate doubt, I believe Mr. Chamberlain would act fairly and squarely
      in deciding the matter; but if he appointed a commission to settle up all
      these questions, I certainly should not expect him to appoint three men,
      if he could find them, who believed that as to the Orkneys the question
      was an open one. I wish to make one last effort to bring about an
      agreement through the Com-mission.... But if there is a disagreement... I
      shall take a position which will prevent any possibility of arbitration
      hereafter;... will render it necessary for Congress to give me the
      authority to run the line as we claim it, by our own people, without any
      further regard to the attitude of England and Canada. If I paid attention
      to mere abstract rights, that is the position I ought to take anyhow. I
      have not taken it because I wish to exhaust every effort to have the
      affair settled peacefully and with due regard to England&rsquo;s honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That is the way to do these things: not by a peremptory public letter,
      like Olney&rsquo;s to Salisbury, which enrages a whole people and makes
      temperate action doubly difficult, but thus, by a private letter to the
      proper persons, very plain, very unmistakable, but which remains private,
      a sufficient word to the wise, and not a red rag to the mob. &ldquo;To have the
      affair settled peacefully and with due regard to England&rsquo;s honor.&rdquo; Thus
      Roosevelt. England desired no war with us this time, any more than at the
      other time. The Commission went to work, and, after investigating the
      facts, decided in our favor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our list of boundary episodes finished, I must touch upon the affair with
      the Kaiser regarding Venezuela&rsquo;s debts. She owed money to Germany, Italy,
      and England. The Kaiser got the ear of the Tory government under
      Salisbury, and between the three countries a secret pact was made to repay
      themselves. Venezuela is not seldom reluctant to settle her obligations,
      and she was slow upon this occasion. It was the Kaiser&rsquo;s chance&mdash;he
      had been trying it already at other points&mdash;to slide into a foothold
      over here under the camouflage of collecting from Venezuela her just debt
      to him. So with warships he and his allies established what he called a
      pacific blockade on Venezuelan ports.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must skip the comedy that now went on in Washington (you will find it on
      pages 287-288 of Mr. Thayer&rsquo;s John Hay, Volume II) and come at once to Mr.
      Roosevelt&rsquo;s final word to the Kaiser, that if there was not an offer to
      arbitrate within forty-eight hours, Admiral Dewey would sail for
      Venezuela. In thirty-six hours arbitration was agreed to. England withdrew
      from her share in the secret pact. Had she wanted war with us, her fleet
      and the Kaiser&rsquo;s could have outmatched our own. She did not; and the
      Kaiser had still very clearly and sorely in remembrance what choice she
      had made between standing with him and standing with us a few years before
      this, upon an occasion that was also connected with Admiral Dewey. This I
      shall fully consider after summarizing those international episodes of our
      Civil War wherein England was concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      This completes my list of minor troubles with England that we have had
      since Canning suggested our Monroe Doctrine in 1823. Minor troubles, I
      call them, because they are all smaller than those during our Civil War.
      The full record of each is an open page of history for you to read at
      leisure in any good library. You will find that the anti-English complex
      has its influence sometimes in the pages of our historians, but Professor
      Dunning is free from it. You will find, whatever transitory gusts of
      anger, jealousy, hostility, or petulance may have swept over the English
      people in their relations with us, these gusts end in a calm; and this
      calm is due to the common-sense of the race. It revealed itself in the
      treaty at the close of our Revolution, and it has been the ultimate
      controlling factor in English dealings with us ever since. And now I reach
      the last of my large historic matters, the Civil War, and our war with
      Spain.

      Chapter XII: On the Ragged Edge
    </h2>
    <p>
      On November 6, 1860, Lincoln, nominee of the Republican party, which was
      opposed to the extension of slavery, was elected President of the United
      States. Forty-one days later, the legislature of South Carolina,
      determined to perpetuate slavery, met at Columbia, but, on account of a
      local epidemic, moved to Charleston. There, about noon, December 20th, it
      unanimously declared &ldquo;that the Union now subsisting between South Carolina
      and other States, under the name of the United States of America, is
      hereby dissolved.&rdquo; Soon other slave states followed this lead, and among
      them all, during those final months of Buchanan&rsquo;s presidency, preparedness
      went on, unchecked by the half-feeble, half-treacherous Federal
      Government. Lincoln, in his inaugural address, March 4, 1861, declared
      that he had no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the
      institution of slavery in the states where it existed. To the seceded
      slave states he said: &ldquo;In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen,
      and not mine, is the momentous issue of civil war. The Government will not
      assail you. You can have no conflict without being yourselves the
      aggressors. You can have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the
      Government; while I shall have the most solemn one to preserve, protect
      and defend it.&rdquo; This changed nothing in the slave states. It was not
      enough for them that slavery could keep on where it was. To spread it
      where it was not, had been their aim for a very long while. The next day,
      March 5th, Lincoln had letters from Fort Sumter, in Charleston harbor.
      Major Anderson was besieged there by the batteries of secession, was being
      starved out, might hold on a month longer, needed help. Through staggering
      complications and embarrassments, which were presently to be outstaggered
      by worse ones, Lincoln by the end of March saw his path clear. &ldquo;In your
      hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not mine, is the momentous
      issue of civil war.&rdquo; The clew to the path had been in those words from the
      first. The flag of the Union, the little island of loyalty amid the waters
      of secession, was covered by the Charleston batteries. &ldquo;Batteries ready to
      open Wednesday or Thursday. What instructions?&rdquo; Thus, on April 1st,
      General Beauregard, at Charleston, telegraphed to Jefferson Davis. They
      had all been hoping that Lincoln would give Fort Sumter to them and so
      save their having to take it. Not at all. The President of the United
      States was not going to give away property of the United States. Instead,
      the Governor of South Caro-lina received a polite message that an attempt
      would be made to supply Fort Sumter with food only, and that if this were
      not interfered with, no arms or ammunition should be sent there without
      further notice, or in case the fort were attacked. Lincoln was leaning
      backwards, you might say, in his patient effort to conciliate. And
      accordingly our transports sailed from New York for Charleston with
      instructions to supply Sumter with food alone, unless they should be
      opposed in attempting to carry out their errand. This did not suit
      Jefferson Davis at all; and, to cut it short, at half-past four, on the
      morning of April 12, 1861, there arose into the air from the mortar
      battery near old Fort Johnson, on the south side of the harbor, a
      bomb-shell, which curved high and slow through the dawn, and fell upon
      Fort Sumter, thus starting four years of civil war. One week later the
      Union proclaimed a blockade on the ports of Slave Land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bear each and all of these facts in mind, I beg, bear them in mind well,
      for in the light of them you can see England clearly, and will have no
      trouble in following the different threads of her conduct towards us
      during this struggle. What she did then gave to our ancient grudge against
      her the reddest coat of fresh paint which it had received yet&mdash;the
      reddest and the most enduring since George III.
    </p>
    <p>
      England ran true to form. It is very interesting to mark this; very
      interesting to watch in her government and her people the persistent and
      conflicting currents of sympathy and antipathy boil up again, just as they
      had boiled in 1776. It is equally interesting to watch our ancient grudge
      at work, causing us to remember and hug all the ill will she bore us, all
      the harm she did us, and to forget all the good. Roughly comparing 1776
      with 1861, it was once more the Tories, the aristocrats, the Lord Norths,
      who hoped for our overthrow, while the people of England, with certain
      liberal leaders in Parliament, stood our friends. Just as Pitt and Burke
      had spoken for us in our Revolution, so Bright and Cobden befriended us
      now. The parallel ceases when you come to the Sovereign. Queen Victoria
      declined to support or recognize Slave Land. She stopped the Government
      and aristocratic England from forcing war upon us, she prevented the
      French Emperor, Napoleon III, from recognizing the Southern Confederacy.
      We shall come to this in its turn. Our Civil War set up in England a huge
      vibration, subjected England to a searching test of herself. Nothing
      describes this better than a letter of Henry Ward Beecher&rsquo;s, written
      during the War, after his return from addressing the people of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My own feelings and judgment underwent a great change while I was in
      England... I was chilled and shocked at the coldness towards the North
      which I everywhere met, and the sympathetic prejudices in favor of the
      South. And yet everybody was alike condemning slavery and praising
      liberty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How could England do this, how with the same breath blow cold and hot, how
      be against the North that was fighting the extension of slavery and yet be
      against slavery too? Confusing at the time, it is clear to-day. Imbedded
      in Lincoln&rsquo;s first inaugural address lies the clew: he said, &ldquo;I have no
      purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of
      slavery where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I
      have no inclination to do so. Those who elected me did so with full
      knowledge that I had made this and many similar declarations, and had
      never recanted them.&rdquo; Thus Lincoln, March 4, 1861. Six weeks later, when
      we went-to war, we went, not &ldquo;to interfere with the institution of
      slavery,&rdquo; but (again in Lincoln&rsquo;s words) &ldquo;to preserve, protect, and
      defend&rdquo; the Union. This was our slogan, this our fight, this was repeated
      again and again by our soldiers and civilians, by our public men and our
      private citizens. Can you see the position of those Englishmen who
      condemned slavery and praised liberty? We ourselves said we were not out
      to abolish slavery, we disclaimed any such object, by our own words we cut
      the ground away from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not until September 22d of 1862, to take effect upon January 1, 1863, did
      Lincoln proclaim emancipation&mdash;thus doing what he had said twenty-two
      months before &ldquo;I believe I have no lawful right to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That interim of anguish and meditation had cleared his sight. Slowly he
      had felt his way, slowly he had come to perceive that the preservation of
      the Union and the abolition of slavery were so tightly wrapped together as
      to merge and be one and the same thing. But even had he known this from
      the start, known that the North&rsquo;s bottom cause, the ending of slavery,
      rested on moral ground, and that moral ground outweighs and must forever
      outweigh whatever of legal argument may be on the other side, he could
      have done nothing. &ldquo;I believe I have no lawful right.&rdquo; There were
      thousands in the North who also thus believed. It was only an extremist
      minority who disregarded the Constitution&rsquo;s acquiescence in slavery and
      wanted emancipation proclaimed at once. Had Lincoln proclaimed it, the
      North would have split in pieces, the South would have won, the Union
      would have perished, and slavery would have remained. Lincoln had to wait
      until the season of anguish and meditation had unblinded thousands besides
      himself, and thus had placed behind him enough of the North to struggle on
      to that saving of the Union and that freeing of the slave which was
      consummated more than two years later by Lee&rsquo;s surrender to Grant at
      Appomattox.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was during that interim of anguish and meditation that England did
      us most of the harm which our memories vaguely but violently treasure.
      Until the Emancipation, we gave our English friends no public, official
      grounds for their sympathy, and consequently their influence over our
      English enemies was hampered. Instantly after January 1, 1863, that
      sympathy became the deciding voice. Our enemies could no longer say to it,
      &ldquo;but Lincoln says himself that he doesn&rsquo;t intend to abolish slavery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here are examples of what occurred: To William Lloyd Garrison, the
      Abolitionist, an English sympathizer wrote that three thousand men of
      Manchester had met there and adopted by acclamation an enthusiastic
      message to Lincoln. These men said that they would rather remain
      unemployed for twenty years than get cotton from the South at the expense
      of the slave. A month later Cobden writes to Charles Sumner: &ldquo;I know
      nothing in my political experience so striking, an a display of
      spontaneous public action, as that of the vast gathering at Exeter Hall
      (in London), when, without one attraction in the form of a popular orator,
      the vast building, its minor rooms and passages, and the streets
      adjoining, were crowded with an enthusiastic audience. That meeting has
      had a powerful effect on our newspapers and politicians. It has closed the
      mouths of those who have been advocating the side of the South. And I now
      write to assure you that any unfriendly act on the part of our Government&mdash;no
      matter which of our aristocratic parties is in power&mdash;towards your
      cause is not to be apprehended. If an attempt were made by the Government
      in any way to commit us to the South, a spirit would be instantly aroused
      which would drive that Government from power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I lay emphasis at this point upon these instances (many more could be
      given) because it has been the habit of most Americans to say that England
      stopped being hostile to the North as soon as the North began to win. In
      January, 1863, the North had not visibly begun to win. It had suffered
      almost unvaried defeat so far; and the battles of Gettysburg and
      Vicksburg, where the tide turned at last our way, were still six months
      ahead. It was from January 1, 1863, when Lincoln planted our cause firmly
      and openly on abolition ground, that the undercurrent of British sympathy
      surged to the top. The true wonder is, that this undercurrent should have
      been so strong all along, that those English sympathizers somehow in their
      hearts should have known what we were fighting for more clearly than we
      had been able to see it; ourselves. The key to this is given in Beecher&rsquo;s
      letter&mdash;it is nowhere better given&mdash;and to it I must now return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I soon perceived that my first error was in supposing that Great Britain
      was an impartial spectator. In fact, she was morally an actor in the
      conflict. Such were the antagonistic influences at work in her own midst,
      and the division of parties, that, in judging American affairs she could
      not help lending sanction to one or the other side of her own internal
      conflicts. England was not, then, a judge, sitting calmly on the bench to
      decide without bias; the case brought before her was her own, in
      principle, and in interest. In taking sides with the North, the common
      people of Great Britain and the laboring class took sides with themselves
      in their struggle for reformation; while the wealthy and the privileged
      classes found a reason in their own political parties and philosophies why
      they should not be too eager for the legitimate government and nation of
      the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All classes who, at home, were seeking the elevation and political
      enfranchisement of the common people, were with us. All who studied the
      preservation of the state in its present unequal distribution of political
      privileges, sided with that section in America that were doing the same
      thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ought not to be surprised nor angry that men should maintain
      aristocratic doctrines which they believe in fully as sincerely, and more
      consistently, than we, or many amongst us do, in democratic doctrines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We of all people ought to understand how a government can be cold or
      semi-hostile, while the people are friendly with us. For thirty years the
      American Government, in the hands, or under the influence of Southern
      statesmen, has been in a threatening attitude to Europe, and actually in
      disgraceful conflict with all the weak neighboring Powers. Texas, Mexico,
      Central Generics, and Cuba are witnesses. Yet the great body of our people
      in the Middle and Northern States are strongly opposed to all such
      tendencies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was in a very brief visit that Beecher managed to see England as she
      was: a remarkable letter for its insight, and more remarkable still for
      its moderation, when you consider that it was written in the midst of our
      Civil War, while loyal Americans were not only enraged with England, but
      wounded to the quick as well. When a man can do this&mdash;can have
      passionate convictions in passionate times, and yet keep his judgment
      unclouded, wise, and calm, he serves his country well.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can remember the rage and the wound. In that atmosphere I began my
      existence. My childhood was steeped in it. In our house the London Punch
      was stopped, because of its hostile ridicule. I grew to boyhood hearing
      from my elders how England had for years taunted us with our tolerance of
      slavery while we boasted of being the Land of the Free&mdash;and then,
      when we arose to abolish slavery, how she &ldquo;jack-knived&rdquo; and gave aid and
      comfort to the slave power when it had its fingers upon our throat. Many
      of that generation of my elders never wholly got over the rage and the
      wound. They hated all England for the sake of less than half England. They
      counted their enemies but never their friends. There&rsquo;s nothing unnatural
      about this, nothing rare. On the contrary, it&rsquo;s the usual, natural, unjust
      thing that human nature does in times of agony. It&rsquo;s the Henry Ward
      Beechers that are rare. In times of agony the average man and woman see
      nothing but their agony. When I look over some of the letters that I
      received from England in 1915&mdash;letters from strangers evoked by a
      book called The Pentecost of Calamity, wherein I had published my
      conviction that the cause of England was righteous, the cause of Germany
      hideous, and our own persistent neutrality unworthy&mdash;I&rsquo;m glad I lost
      my temper only once, and replied caustically only once. How dreadful
      (wrote one of my correspondents) must it be to belong to a nation that was
      behaving like mine! I retorted (I&rsquo;m sorry for it now) that I could all the
      more readily comprehend English feeling about our neutrality, because I
      had known what we had felt when Gladstone spoke at Newcastle and when
      England let the Alabama loose upon us in 1862. Where was the good in
      replying at all? Silence is almost always the best reply in these cases.
      Next came a letter from another English stranger, in which the writer
      announced having just read The Pentecost of Calamity. Not a word of
      friendliness for what I had said about the righteousness of England&rsquo;s
      cause or my expressed unhappiness over the course which our Government had
      taken&mdash;nothing but scorn for us all and the hope that we should reap
      our deserts when Germany defeated England and invaded us. Well? What of
      it? Here was a stricken person, writing in stress, in a land of
      desolation, mourning for the dead already, waiting for the next who should
      die, a poor, unstrung average person, who had not long before read that
      remark of our President&rsquo;s made on the morrow of the Lusitania: that there
      is such a thing as being too proud to fight; had read during the ensuing
      weeks those notes wherein we stood committed by our Chief Magistrate to a
      verbal slinking away and sitting down under it. Can you wonder? If the
      mere memory of those days of our humiliation stabs me even now, I need no
      one to tell me (though I have been told) what England, what France, felt
      about us then, what it must have been like for Americans who were in
      England and France at that time. No: the average person in great trouble
      cannot rise above the trouble and survey the truth and be just. In English
      eyes our Government&mdash;and therefore all of us&mdash;failed in 1914&mdash;1915&mdash;1916&mdash;failed
      again and again&mdash;insulted the cause of humanity when we said through
      our President in 1916, the third summer of the war, that we were not
      concerned with either the causes or the aims of that conflict. How could
      they remember Hoover, or Robert Bacon, or Leonard Wood, or Theodore
      Roosevelt then, any more than we could remember John Bright, or Richard
      Cobden, or the Manchester men in the days when the Alabama was sinking the
      merchant vessels of the Union?
    </p>
    <p>
      We remembered Lord John Russell and Lord Palmerston in the British
      Government, and their fellow aristocrats in British society; we remembered
      the aristocratic British press&mdash;The Times notably, because the most
      powerful&mdash;these are what we saw, felt, and remembered, because they
      were not with us, and were able to hurt us in the days when our friends
      were not yet able to help us. They made welcome the Southerners who came
      over in the interests of the South, they listened to the Southern
      propaganda. Why? Because the South was the American version of their
      aristocratic creed. To those who came over in the interests of the North
      and of the Union they turned a cold shoulder, because they represented
      Democracy; moreover, a Dis-United States would prove in commerce a less
      formidable competitor. To Captain Bullock, the able and energetic
      Southerner who put through in England the building and launching of those
      Confederate cruisers which sank our ships and destroyed our merchant
      marine, and to Mason and Slidell, the doors of dukes opened pleasantly;
      Beecher and our other emissaries mostly had to dine beneath uncoroneted
      roofs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the pages of Henry Adams, and of Charles Francis Adams his brother, you
      can read of what they, as young men, encountered in London, and what they
      saw their father have to put up with there, both from English society and
      the English Government. Their father was our new minister to England,
      appointed by Lincoln. He arrived just after our Civil War had begun. I
      have heard his sons talk about it familiarly, and it is all to be found in
      their writings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody knows how to be disagreeable quite so well as the English
      gentleman, except the English lady. They can do it with the nicety of a
      medicine dropper. They can administer the precise quantum suff. in every
      case. In the society of English gentlemen and ladies Mr. Adams by his
      official position was obliged to move. They left him out as much as they
      could, but, being the American Minister, he couldn&rsquo;t be left out
      altogether. At their dinners and functions he had to hear open expressions
      of joy at the news of Southern victories, he had to receive slights both
      veiled and unveiled, and all this he had to bear with equanimity.
      Sometimes he did leave the room; but with dignity and discretion. A false
      step, a &ldquo;break,&rdquo; might have led to a request for his recall. He knew that
      his constant presence, close to the English Government, was vital to our
      cause. Russell and Palmerston were by turns insolent and shifty, and once
      on the very brink of recognizing the Southern Confederacy as an
      independent nation. Gladstone, Chancellor of the Exchequer, in a speech at
      Newcastle, virtually did recognize it. You will be proud of Mr. Adams if
      you read how he bore himself and fulfilled his appallingly delicate and
      difficult mission. He was an American who knew how to behave himself, and
      he behaved himself all the time; while the English had a way of turning
      their behavior on and off, like the hot water. Mr. Adams was no admirer of
      &ldquo;shirt-sleeves&rdquo; diplomacy. His diplomacy wore a coat. Our experiments in
      &ldquo;shirt-sleeves&rdquo; diplomacy fail to show that it accomplishes anything which
      diplomacy decently dressed would not accomplish more satisfactorily. Upon
      Mr. Adams fell some consequences of previous American crudities, of which
      I shall speak later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln had declared a blockade on Southern ports before Mr. Adams arrived
      in London. Upon his arrival he found England had proclaimed her neutrality
      and recognized the belligerency of the South. This dismayed Mr. Adams and
      excited the whole North, because feeling ran too high to perceive this
      first act on England&rsquo;s part to be really favorable to us; she could not
      recognize our blockade, which stopped her getting Southern cotton, unless
      she recognized that the South was in a state of war with us. Looked at
      quietly, this act of England&rsquo;s helped us and hurt herself, for it deprived
      her of cotton.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not with this, but with the reception and treatment of Mr. Adams
      that the true hostility began. Slights to him were slaps at us, sympathy
      with the South was an active moral injury to our cause, even if it was
      mostly an undertone, politically. Then all of a sudden, something that we
      did ourselves changed the undertone to a loud overtone, and we just grazed
      England&rsquo;s declaring war on us. Had she done so, then indeed it had been
      all up with us. This incident is the comic going-back on our own doctrine
      of 1812, to which I have alluded above.
    </p>
    <p>
      On November 8, 1861, Captain Charles Wilkes of the American steam sloop
      San Jacinto, fired a shot across the bow of the British vessel Trent,
      stopped her on the high seas, and took four passengers off her, and
      brought them prisoners to Fort Warren, in Boston harbor. Mason and Slidell
      are the two we remember, Confederate envoys to France and Great Britain.
      Over this the whole North burst into glorious joy. Our Secretary of the
      Navy wrote to Wilkes his congratulations, Congress voted its thanks to
      him, governors and judges laureled him with oratory at banquets, he was
      feasted with meat and drink all over the place, and, though his years were
      sixty-three, ardent females probably rushed forth from throngs and kissed
      him with the purest intentions: heroes have no age. But presently the
      Trent arrived in England, and the British lion was aroused. We had
      violated international law, and insulted the British flag. Palmerston
      wrote us a letter&mdash;or Russell, I forget which wrote it&mdash;a letter
      that would have left us no choice but to fight. But Queen Victoria had to
      sign it before it went. &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you must know that I will
      agree to no paper that means war with the United States.&rdquo; So this didn&rsquo;t
      go, but another in its stead, pretty stiff, naturally, yet still possible
      for us to swallow. Some didn&rsquo;t want to swallow even this; but Lincoln,
      humorous and wise, said, &ldquo;Gentlemen, one war at a time;&rdquo; and so we made
      due restitution, and Messrs. Mason and Slidell went their way to France
      and England, free to bring about action against us there if they could
      manage it. Captain Wilkes must have been a good fellow. His picture
      suggests this. England, in her English heart, really liked what he had
      done, it was in its gallant flagrancy so remarkably like her own doings&mdash;though
      she couldn&rsquo;t, naturally, permit such a performance to pass; and a few
      years afterwards, for his services in the cause of exploration, her Royal
      Geographical Society gave him a gold medal! Yes; the whole thing is comic&mdash;to-day;
      for us, to-day, the point of it is, that the English Queen saved us from a
      war with England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within a year, something happened that was not comic. Lord John Russell,
      though warned and warned, let the Alabama slip away to sea, where she
      proceeded to send our merchant ships to the bottom, until the Kearsarge
      sent her herself to the bottom. She had been built at Liverpool in the
      face of an English law which no quibbling could disguise to anybody except
      to Lord John Russell and to those who, like him, leaned to the South. Ten
      years later, this leaning cost England fifteen million dollars in damages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us now listen to what our British friends were saying in those years
      before Lincoln issued his Emancipation Proclamation. His blockade had
      brought immediate and heavy distress upon many English workmen and their
      families. That had been April 19, 1861. By September, five sixths of the
      Lancashire cotton-spinners were out of work, or working half time. Their
      starvation and that of their wives and children could be stemmed by
      charity alone. I have talked with people who saw those thousands in their
      suffering. Yet those thousands bore it. They somehow looked through
      Lincoln&rsquo;s express disavowal of any intention to interfere with slavery,
      and saw that at bottom our war was indeed against slavery, that slavery
      was behind the Southern camouflage about independence, and behind the
      Northern slogan about preserving the Union. They saw and they stuck.
      &ldquo;Rarely,&rdquo; writes Charles Francis Adams, &ldquo;in the history of mankind, has
      there been a more creditable exhibition of human sympathy.&rdquo; France was
      likewise damaged by our blockade; and Napoleon III would have liked to
      recognize the South. He established, through Maximilian, an empire in
      Mexico, behind which lay hostility to our Democracy. He wished us defeat;
      but he was afraid to move without England, to whom he made a succession of
      indirect approaches. These nearly came to something towards the close of
      1862. It was on October 7th that Gladstone spoke at Newcastle about
      Jefferson Davis having made a nation. Yet, after all, England didn&rsquo;t
      budge, and thus held Napoleon back. From France in the end the South got
      neither ships nor recognition, in spite of his deceitful connivance and
      desire; Napoleon flirted a while with Slidell, but grew cold when he saw
      no chance of English cooperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides John Bright and Cobden, we had other English friends of influence
      and celebrity: John Stuart Mill, Thomas Hughes, Goldwin Smith, Leslie
      Stephen, Robert Gladstone, Frederic Harrison are some of them. All from
      the first supported us. All from the first worked and spoke for us. The
      Union and Emancipation Society was founded. &ldquo;Your Committee,&rdquo; says its
      final report when the war was ended, &ldquo;have issued and circulated upwards
      of four hundred thousand books, pamphlets, and tracts... and nearly five
      hundred official and public meetings have been held...&rdquo; The president of
      this Society, Mr. Potter, spent thirty thousand dollars in the cause, and
      at a time when times were hard and fortunes as well as cotton-spinners in
      distress through our blockade. Another member of the Society, Mr.
      Thompson, writes of one of the public meetings: &ldquo;... I addressed a crowded
      assembly of unemployed operatives in the town of Heywood, near Manchester,
      and spoke to them for two hours about the Slaveholders&rsquo; Rebellion. They
      were united and vociferous in the expression of their willingness to
      suffer all hardships consequent upon a want of cotton, if thereby the
      liberty of the victims of Southern despotism might be promoted. All honor
      to the half million of our working population in Lancashire, Cheshire, and
      elsewhere, who are bearing with heroic fortitude the privation which your
      war has entailed upon them!... Their sublime resignation, their
      self-forgetfulness, their observance of law, their whole-souled love of
      the cause of human freedom, their quick and clear perception of the merits
      of the question between the North and the South... are extorting the
      admiration of all classes of the community ...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How much of all this do you ever hear from the people who remember the
      Alabama?
    </p>
    <p>
      Strictly in accord with Beecher&rsquo;s vivid summary of the true England in our
      Civil War, are some passages of a letter from Mr. John Bigelow, who was at
      that time our Consul-General at Paris, and whose impressions, written to
      our Secretary of State, Mr. Seward, on February 6, 1863, are interesting
      to compare with what Beecher says in that letter, from which I have
      already given extracts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The anti-slavery meetings in England are having their effect upon the
      Government already... The Paris correspondent of the London Post also came
      to my house on Wednesday evening... He says... that there are about a
      dozen persons who by their position and influence over the organs of
      public opinion have produced all the bad feeling and treacherous con-duct
      of England towards America. They are people who, as members of the
      Government in times past, have been bullied by the U. S.... They are not
      entirely ignorant that the class who are now trying to overthrow the
      Government were mainly responsible for the brutality, but they think we as
      a nation are disposed to bully, and they are disposed to assist in any
      policy that may dismember and weaken us. These scars of wounded pride,
      however, have been carefully concealed from the public, who therefore
      cannot be readily made to see why, when the President has distinctly made
      the issue between slave labor and free labor, that England should not go
      with the North. He says these dozen people who rule England hate us
      cordially... &rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were more than a dozen, a good many more, as we know from Charles
      and Henry Adams. But read once again the last paragraph of Beecher&rsquo;s
      letter, and note how it corresponds with what Mr. Bigelow says about the
      feeling which our Government (for thirty years &ldquo;in the hands or under the
      influence of Southern statesmen&rdquo;) had raised against us by its bad manners
      to European governments. This was the harvest sown by shirt sleeves
      diplomacy and reaped by Mr. Adams in 1861. Only seven years before, we had
      gratuitously offended four countries at once. Three of our foreign
      ministers (two of them from the South) had met at Ostend and later at Aix
      in the interests of extending slavery, and there, in a joint manifesto,
      had ordered Spain to sell us Cuba, or we would take Cuba by force. One of
      the three was our minister to Spain. Spain had received him courteously as
      the representative of a nation with whom she was at peace. It was like
      ringing the doorbell of an acquaintance, being shown into the parlor and
      telling him he must sell you his spoons or you would snatch them. This
      doesn&rsquo;t incline your neighbor to like you. But, as has been said, Mr.
      Adams was an American who did know how to behave, and thereby served us
      well in our hour of need.
    </p>
    <p>
      We remember the Alabama and our English enemies, we forget Bright, and
      Cobden, and all our English friends; but Lincoln did not forget them. When
      a young man, a friend of Bright&rsquo;s, an Englishman, had been caught here in
      a plot to seize a vessel and make her into another Alabama, John Bright
      asked mercy for him; and here are Lincoln&rsquo;s words in consequence: &ldquo;whereas
      one Rubery was convicted on or about the twelfth day of October, 1863, in
      the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of California, of
      engaging in, and giving aid and comfort to the existing rebellion against
      the Government of this Country, and sentenced to ten years&rsquo; imprisonment,
      and to pay a fine of ten thousand dollars;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And whereas, the said Alfred Rubery is of the immature age of twenty
      years, and of highly respectable parentage;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And whereas, the said Alfred Rubery is a subject of Great Britain, and
      his pardon is desired by John Bright, of England;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the
      United States of America, these and divers other considerations me
      thereunto moving, and especially as a public mark of the esteem held by
      the United States of America for the high character and steady friendship
      of the said John Bright, do hereby grant a pardon to the said Alfred
      Rubery, the same to begin and take effect on the twentieth day of January
      1864, on condition that he leave the country within thirty days from and
      after that date.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus Lincoln, because of Bright; and because of a word from Bright to
      Charles Sumner about the starving cotton-spinners, Americans sent from New
      York three ships with flour for those faithful English friends of ours.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, at Geneva in 1872, England paid us for what the Alabama had
      done. This Court of Arbitration grew slowly; suggested first by Mr. Thomas
      Batch to Lincoln, who thought the millennium wasn&rsquo;t quite at hand but
      favored &ldquo;airing the idea.&rdquo; The idea was not aired easily. Cobden would
      have brought it up in Parliament, but illness and death overtook him. The
      idea found but few other friends. At last Horace Greeley &ldquo;aired&rdquo; it in his
      paper. On October 23, 1863, Mr. Adams said to Lord John Russell, &ldquo;I am
      directed to say that there is no fair and equitable form of conventional
      arbitrament or reference to which the United States will not be willing to
      submit.&rdquo; This, some two years later, Russell recalled, saying in reply to
      a statement of our grievances by Adams: &ldquo;It appears to Her Majesty&rsquo;s
      Government that there are but two questions by which the claim of
      compensation could be tested; the one is, Have the British Government
      acted with due diligence, or, in other words, in good faith and honesty,
      in the maintenance of the neutrality they proclaimed? The other is, Have
      the law officers of the Crown properly understood the foreign enlistment
      act, when they declined, in June 1862, to advise the detention and seizure
      of the Alabama, and on other occasions when they were asked to detain
      other ships, building or fitting in British ports? It appears to Her
      Majesty&rsquo;s Government that neither of these questions could be put to a
      foreign government with any regard to the dignity and character of the
      British Crown and the British Nation. Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government are the
      sole guardians of their own honor. They cannot admit that they have acted
      with bad faith in maintaining the neutrality they professed. The law
      officers of the Crown must be held to be better interpreters of a British
      statute than any foreign Government can be presumed to be...&rdquo; He consented
      to a commission, but drew the line at any probing of England&rsquo;s good faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      We persisted. In 1868, Lord Westbury, Lord High Chancellor, declared in
      the House of Lords that &ldquo;the animus with which the neutral powers acted
      was the only true criterion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This is the test which we asked should be applied. We quoted British
      remarks about us, Gladstone, for example, as evidence of unfriendly and
      insincere animus on the part of those at the head of the British
      Government.
    </p>
    <p>
      Replying to our pressing the point of animus, the British Government
      reasserted Russell&rsquo;s refusal to recognize or entertain any question of
      England&rsquo;s good faith: &ldquo;first, because it would be inconsistent with the
      self-respect which every government is bound to feel....&rdquo; In Mr. John
      Bassett Moore&rsquo;s History of International Arbitration, Vol. I, pages
      496-497, or in papers relating to the Treaty of Washington, Vol. II,
      Geneva Arbitration, page 204... Part I, Introductory Statement, you will
      find the whole of this. What I give here suffices to show the position we
      ourselves and England took about the Alabama case. She backed down. Her
      good faith was put in issue, and she paid our direct claims. She ate
      &ldquo;humble pie.&rdquo; We had to eat humble pie in the affair of the Trent. It has
      been done since. It is not pleasant, but it may be beneficial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is the story of the true England and the true America in 1861; the
      divided North with which Lincoln had to deal, the divided England where
      our many friends could do little to check our influential enemies, until
      Lincoln came out plainly against slavery. I have had to compress much, but
      I have omitted nothing material, of which I am aware. The facts would
      embarrass those who determine to assert that England was our undivided
      enemy during our Civil War, if facts ever embarrassed a complex. Those
      afflicted with the complex can keep their eyes upon the Alabama and the
      London Times, and avert them from Bright, and Cobden, and the
      cotton-spinners, and the Union and Emancipation Society, and Queen
      Victoria. But to any reader of this whose complex is not incurable, or who
      has none, I will put this question: What opinion of the brains of any
      Englishman would you have if he formed his idea of the United States
      exclusively from the newspapers of William Randolph Hearst.

      Chapter XIII: Benefits Forgot
    </h2>
    <p>
      In our next war, our war with Spain in 1898, England saved us from
      Germany. She did it from first to last; her position was unmistakable, and
      every determining act of hers was as our friend. The service that she
      rendered us in warning Germany to keep out of it, was even greater than
      her suggestion of our Monroe doctrine in 1823; for in 1823 she put us on
      guard against meditated, but remote, assault from Europe, while in 1898
      she actively averted a serious and imminent peril. As the threat of her
      fleet had obstructed Napoleon in 1803, and the Holy Alliance in 1823, so
      in 1898 it blocked the Kaiser. Late in that year, when it was all over,
      the disappointed and baffled Kaiser wrote to a friend of Joseph
      Chamberlain, &ldquo;If I had had a larger fleet I would have taken Uncle Sam by
      the scruff of the neck.&rdquo; Have you ever read what our own fleet was like in
      those days? Or our Army? Lucky it was for us that we had to deal only with
      Spain. And even the Spanish fleet would have been a much graver opponent
      in Manila Bay, but for Lord Cromer. On its way from Spain through the Suez
      Canal a formidable part of Spain&rsquo;s navy stopped to coal at Port Said.
      There is a law about the coaling of belligerent warships in neutral ports.
      Lord Cromer could have construed that law just as well against us. His
      construction brought it about that those Spanish ships couldn&rsquo;t get to
      Manila Bay in time to take part against Admiral Dewey. The Spanish War
      revealed that our Navy could hit eight times out of a hundred, and was in
      other respects unprepared and utterly inadequate to cope with a
      first-class power. In consequence of this, and the criticisms of our Navy
      Department, which Admiral Sims as a young man had written, Roosevelt took
      the steps he did in his first term. Three ticklish times in that Spanish
      War England stood our friend against Germany. When it broke out, German
      agents approached Mr. Balfour, proposing that England join in a European
      combination in Spain&rsquo;s favor. Mr. Balfour&rsquo;s refusal is common knowledge,
      except to the monomaniac with his complex. Next came the action of Lord
      Cromer, and finally that moment in Manila Bay when England took her stand
      by our side and Germany saw she would have to fight us both, if she fought
      at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you saw any German or French papers at the time of our troubles with
      Spain, you saw undisguised hostility. If you have talked with any American
      who was in Paris during that April of 1898, your impression will be more
      vivid still. There was an outburst of European hate for us. Germany,
      France, and Austria all looked expectantly to England&mdash;and England
      disappointed their expectations. The British Press was as much for us as
      the French and German press were hostile; the London Spectator said: &ldquo;We
      are not, and we do not pretend to be, an agreeable people, but when there
      is trouble in the family, we know where our hearts are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In those same days (somewhere about the third week in April, 1898), at the
      British Embassy in Washington, occurred a scene of significance and
      interest, which has probably been told less often than that interview
      between Mr. Balfour and the Kaiser&rsquo;s emissary in London. The British
      Ambassador was standing at his window, looking out at the German Embassy,
      across the street. With him was a member of his diplomatic household. The
      two watched what was happening. One by one, the representatives of various
      European nations were entering the door of the German Embassy. &ldquo;Do you see
      them?&rdquo; said the Ambassador&rsquo;s companion; &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll all be in there soon.
      There. That&rsquo;s the last of them.&rdquo; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t notice the French Ambassador.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s gone in, too.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m surprised at that. I&rsquo;m sorry for that. I
      didn&rsquo;t think he would be one of them,&rdquo; said the British ambassador. &ldquo;Now,
      I&rsquo;ll tell you what. They&rsquo;ll all be coming over here in a little while. I
      want you to wait and be present.&rdquo; Shortly this prediction was verified.
      Over from the German Embassy came the whole company on a visit to the
      British Ambassador, that he might add his signature to a document to which
      they had affixed theirs. He read it quietly. We may easily imagine its
      purport, since we know of the meditated European coalition against us at
      she time of our war with Spain. Then the British Ambassador remarked: &ldquo;I
      have no orders from my Government to sign any such document as that. And
      if I did have, I should resign my post rather than sign it.&rdquo; A pause: The
      company fell silent. &ldquo;Then what will your Excellency do?&rdquo; inquired one
      visitor. &ldquo;If you will all do me the honor of coming back to-morrow, I
      shall have another document ready which all of us can sign.&rdquo; That is what
      happened to the European coalition at this end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some few years later, that British Ambassador came to die; and to the
      British Embassy repaired Theodore Roosevelt. &ldquo;Would it be possible for us
      to arrange,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a funeral more honored and marked than the United
      States has ever accorded to any one not a citizen? I should like it. And,&rdquo;
       he suddenly added, shaking his fist at the German Embassy over the way,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to grind all their noses in the dirt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Confronted with the awkward fact that Britain was almost unanimously with
      us, from Mr. Balfour down through the British press to the British people,
      those nations whose ambassadors had paid so unsuccessful a call at the
      British Embassy had to give it up. Their coalition never came off. Such a
      thing couldn&rsquo;t come off without England, and England said No.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, Lord Cromer, at Port Said, stretched out the arm of international
      law, and laid it upon the Spanish fleet. Belligerents may legally take
      coal enough at neutral ports to reach their nearest &ldquo;home port.&rdquo; That
      Spanish fleet was on its way from Spain to Manila through the Suez Canal.
      It could have reached there, had Lord Cromer allowed it coal enough to
      make the nearest home port ahead of it&mdash;Manila. But there was a home
      port behind it, still nearer, namely, Barcelona. He let it take coal
      enough to get back to Barcelona. Thus, England again stepped in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third time was in Manila Bay itself, after Dewey&rsquo;s victory, and while
      he was in occupation of the place. Once more the Kaiser tried it, not
      discouraged by his failure with Mr. Balfour and the British Government. He
      desired the Philippines for himself; we had not yet acquired them; we were
      policing them, superintending the harbor, administering whatever had
      fallen to us from Spain&rsquo;s defeat. The Kaiser sent, under Admiral Diedrich,
      a squadron stronger than Dewey&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dewey indicated where the German was to anchor. &ldquo;I am here by the order of
      his Majesty the German Emperor,&rdquo; said Diedrich, and chose his own place to
      anchor. He made it quite plain in other ways that he was taking no orders
      from America. Dewey, so report has it, at last told him that &ldquo;if he wanted
      a fight he could have it at the drop of the hat.&rdquo; Then it was that the
      German called on the English Admiral, Chichester, who was likewise at
      hand, anchored in Manila Bay. &ldquo;What would you do,&rdquo; inquired Diedrich, &ldquo;in
      the event of trouble between Admiral Dewey and myself?&rdquo; &ldquo;That is a secret
      known only to Admiral Dewey and me,&rdquo; said the Englishman. Plainer talk
      could hardly be. Diedrich, though a German, understood it. He returned to
      his flagship. What he saw next morning was the British cruiser in a new
      place, interposed between Dewey and himself. Once more, he understood; and
      he and his squadron sailed off; and it was soon after this incident that
      the disappointed Kaiser wrote that, if only his fleet had been larger, he
      would have taken us by the scruff of the neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tell these things to the next man you hear talking about George III or the
      Alabama. You may meet him in front of a bulletin board, or in a
      drawing-room. He is amongst us everywhere, in the street and in the house.
      He may be a paid propagandist or merely a silly ignorant puppet. But
      whatever he is, he will not find much to say in response, unless it be
      vain, sterile chatter. True come-back will fail him as it failed that man
      by the bulletin board who asked, &ldquo;What is England doing, anyhow?&rdquo; and his
      neighbor answered, &ldquo;Her fleet&rsquo;s keeping the Kaiser out of your front
      yard.&rdquo;

      Chapter XIV: England the Slacker!
    </h2>
    <p>
      What did England do in the war, anyhow?
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us have these disregarded facts also. From the shelves of history I
      have pulled down and displayed the facts which our school textbooks have
      suppressed; I have told the events wherein England has stood our timely
      friend throughout a century; events which our implanted prejudice leads us
      to ignore, or to forget; events which show that any one who says England
      is our hereditary enemy might just about as well say twice two is five.
    </p>
    <p>
      What did England do in the war, anyhow?
    </p>
    <p>
      They go on asking it. The propagandists, the prompted puppets, the paid
      parrots of the press, go on saying these eight senseless words because
      they are easy to say, since the man who can answer them is generally not
      there: to every man who is a responsible master of facts we have&mdash;well,
      how many?&mdash;irresponsible shouters in this country. What is your
      experience? How often is it your luck&mdash;as it was mine in front of the
      bulletin board&mdash;to see a fraud or a fool promptly and satisfactorily
      put in his place? Make up your mind that wherever you hear any person
      whatsoever, male or female, clean or unclean, dressed in jeans, or dressed
      in silks and laces, inquire what England &ldquo;did in the war, anyhow?&rdquo; such
      person either shirks knowledge, or else is a fraud or a fool. Tell them
      what the man said in the street about the Kaiser and our front yard, but
      don&rsquo;t stop there. Tell them that in May, 1918, England was sending men of
      fifty and boys of eighteen and a half to the front; that in August, 1918,
      every third male available between those years was fighting, that eight
      and a half million men for army and navy were raised by the British
      Empire, of which Ireland&rsquo;s share was two and three tenths per cent, Wales
      three and seven tenths, Scotland&rsquo;s eight and three tenths, and England&rsquo;s
      more than sixty per cent; and that this, taken proportionately to our
      greater population would have amounted to about thirteen million
      Americans, When the war started, the British Empire maintained three
      soldiers out of every 2600 of the population; her entire army, regular
      establishment, reserve and territorial forces, amounted to seven hundred
      thousand men. Our casualties were three hundred and twenty-two thousand,
      one hundred and eighty-two. The casualties in the British Army were three
      million, forty-nine thousand, nine hundred and seventy-one&mdash;a million
      more than we sent&mdash;and of these six hundred and fifty-eight thousand,
      seven hundred and four, were killed. Of her Navy, thirty-three thousand
      three hundred and sixty-one were killed, six thousand four hundred and
      five wounded and missing; of her merchant marine fourteen thousand six
      hundred and sixty-one were killed; a total of forty-eight thousand killed&mdash;or
      ten per cent of all in active service. Some of those of the merchant
      marine who escaped drowning through torpedoes and mines went back to sea
      after being torpedoed five, six, and seven times.
    </p>
    <p>
      What did England do in the war, anyhow?
    </p>
    <p>
      Through four frightful years she fought with splendor, she suffered with
      splendor, she held on with splendor. The second battle of Ypres is but one
      drop in the sea of her epic courage; yet it would fill full a canto of a
      poem. So spent was Britain&rsquo;s single line, so worn and thin, that after all
      the men available were brought, gaps remained. No more ammunition was
      coming to these men, the last rounds had been served. Wet through, heavy
      with mud, they were shelled for three days to prevent sleep. Many came at
      last to sleep standing; and being jogged awake when officers of the line
      passed down the trenches, would salute and instantly be asleep again. On
      the fourth day, with the Kaiser come to watch them crumble, three lines of
      Huns, wave after wave of Germany&rsquo;s picked troops, fell and broke upon this
      single line of British&mdash;and it held. The Kaiser, had he known of the
      exhausted ammunition and the mounded dead, could have walked unarmed to
      the Channel. But he never knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surgeons being scantier than men at Ypres, one with a compound fracture of
      the thigh had himself propped up, and thus all day worked on the wounded
      at the front. He knew it meant death for him. The day over, he let them
      carry him to the rear, and there, from blood-poisoning, he died. Thus
      through four frightful years, the British met their duty and their death.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is the great story of the little penny steamers of the Thames&mdash;a
      story lost amid the gigantic whole. Who will tell it right? Who will make
      this drop of perfect valor shine in prose or verse for future eyes to see?
      Imagine a Hoboken ferry boat, because her country needed her, starting for
      San Francisco around Cape Horn, and getting there. Some ten or eleven
      penny steamers under their own steam started from the Thames down the
      Channel, across the Bay of Biscay, past Gibraltar, and through the
      submarined Mediterranean for the River Tigris. Boats of shallow draught
      were urgently needed on the River Tigris. Four or five reached their
      destination. Where are the rest?
    </p>
    <p>
      What did England do in the war, anyhow?
    </p>
    <p>
      During 1917-1918 Britain&rsquo;s armies held the enemy in three continents and
      on six fronts, and cooperated with her Allies on two more fronts. Her
      dead, those six hundred and fifty-eight thousand dead, lay by the Tigris,
      the Zambesi, the AEgean, and across the world to Flanders&rsquo; fields. Between
      March 21st and April 17th, 1918, the Huns in their drive used 127
      divisions, and of these 102 were concentrated against the British. That
      was in Flanders. Britain, at the same time she was fighting in Flanders,
      had also at various times shared in the fighting in Russia, Kiaochau, New
      Guinea, Samoa, Mesopotamia, Palestine, Egypt, the Sudan, Cameroons,
      Togoland, East Africa, South West Africa, Saloniki, Aden, Persia, and the
      northwest frontier of India. Britain cleared twelve hundred thousand
      square miles of the enemy in German colonies. While fighting in
      Mesopotamia, her soldiers were reconstructing at the same time. They
      reclaimed and cultivated more than 1100 square miles of land there, which
      produced in consequence enough food to save two million tons of shipping
      annually for the Allies. In Palestine and Mesopotamia alone, British
      troops in 1917 took 23,590 prisoners. In 1918, in Palestine from September
      18th to October 7th, they took 79,000 prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      What did England do in the war, anyhow?
    </p>
    <p>
      With &ldquo;French&rsquo;s contemptible little army&rdquo; she saved France at the start&mdash;but
      I&rsquo;ll skip that&mdash;except to mention that one division lost 10,000 out
      of 12,000 men, and 350 out of 400 officers. At Zeebrugge and Ostend&mdash;do
      not forget the Vindictive&mdash;she dealt with submarines in April and
      May, 1918&mdash;but I&rsquo;ll skip that; I cannot set down all that she did,
      either at the start, or nearing the finish, or at any particular moment
      during those four years and three months that she was helping to hold
      Germany off from the throat of the world; it would make a very thick book.
      But I am giving you enough, I think, wherewith to answer the ignorant, and
      the frauds, and the fools. Tell them that from 1916 to 1918 Great Britain
      increased her tillage area by four million acres: wheat 39 per cent,
      barley 11, oats 35, potatoes 50&mdash;in spite of the shortage of labor.
      She used wounded soldiers, college boys and girls, boy scouts, refugees,
      and she produced the biggest grain crop in fifty years. She started
      fourteen hundred thousand new war gardens; most of those who worked them
      had worked already a long day in a munition factory. These devoted workers
      increased the potato crop in 1917 by three million tons&mdash;and thus
      released British provision ships to carry our soldiers across. In that
      Boston speech which one of my correspondents referred to, our Secretary of
      the Navy did not mention this. Mention it yourself. And tell them about
      the boy scouts and the women. Fifteen thousand of the boy scouts joined
      the colors, and over fifty thousand of the younger members served in
      various ways at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of England&rsquo;s women seven million were engaged in work on munitions and
      other necessaries and apparatus of war. The terrible test of that second
      battle of Ypres, to which I have made brief allusion above, wrought an
      industrial revolution in the manufacture of shells. The energy of
      production rose at a rate which may be indicated by two or three
      comparisons: In 1917 as many heavy howitzer shells were turned out in a
      single day as in the whole first year of the war, as many medium shells in
      five days, and as many field-gun shells in eight days. Or in other words,
      45 times as many field-gun shells, 73 times as many medium, and 365 times
      as many heavy howitzer shells, were turned out in 1917 as in the first
      year of the war. These shells were manufactured in buildings totaling
      fifteen miles in length, forty feet in breadth, with more than ten
      thousand machine tools driven by seventeen miles of shafting with an
      energy of twenty-five thousand horse-power and a weekly output of over ten
      thousand tons&rsquo; weight of projectiles&mdash;all this largely worked by the
      women of England. While the fleet had increased its personnel from 136,000
      to about 400,000, and 2,000,000 men by July, 1915, had voluntarily
      enlisted in the army before England gave up her birthright and accepted
      compulsory service, the women of England left their ordinary lives to
      fabricate the necessaries of war. They worked at home while their
      husbands, brothers, and sons fought and died on six battle fronts abroad&mdash;six
      hundred and fifty-eight thousand died, remember; do you remember the
      number of Americans killed in action?&mdash;less than thirty-six thousand;&mdash;those
      English women worked on, seven millions of them at least, on milk carts,
      motor-busses, elevators, steam engines, and in making ammunition. Never
      before had any woman worked on more than 150 of the 500 different
      processes that go to the making of munitions. They now handled T. N. T.,
      and fulminate of mercury, more deadly still; helped build guns, gun
      carriages, and three-and-a-half ton army cannons; worked overhead
      traveling cranes for moving the boilers of battleships: turned lathes,
      made every part of an aeroplane. And who were these seven million women?
      The eldest daughter of a duke and the daughter of a general won
      distinction in advanced munition work. The only daughter of an old Army
      family broke down after a year&rsquo;s work in a base hospital in France, was
      ordered six months&rsquo; rest at home, but after two months entered a munition
      factory as an ordinary employee and after nine months&rsquo; work had lost but
      five minutes working time. The mother of seven enlisted sons went into
      munitions not to be behind them in serving England, and one of them wrote
      her she was probably killing more Germans than any of the family. The
      stewardess of a torpedoed passenger ship was among the few survivors.
      Reaching land, she got a job at a capstan lathe. Those were the seven
      million women of England&mdash;daughters of dukes, torpedoed stewardesses,
      and everything between.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seven hundred thousand of these were engaged on munition work proper. They
      did from 60 to 70 per cent of all the machine work on shells, fuses, and
      trench warfare supplies, and 1450 of them were trained mechanics to the
      Royal Flying Corps. They were employed upon practically every operation in
      factory, in foundry, in laboratory, and chemical works, of which they were
      physically capable; in making of gauges, forging billets, making fuses,
      cartridges, bullets&mdash;&ldquo;look what they can do,&rdquo; said a foreman, &ldquo;ladies
      from homes where they sat about and were waited upon.&rdquo; They also made
      optical glass; drilled and tapped in the shipyards; renewed electric wires
      and fittings, wound armatures; lacquered guards for lamps and radiator
      fronts; repaired junction and section boxes, fire control instruments,
      automatic searchlights. &ldquo;We can hardly believe our eyes,&rdquo; said another
      foreman, &ldquo;when we see the heavy stuff brought to and from the shops in
      motor lorries driven by girls. Before the war it was all carted by horses
      and men. The girls do the job all right, though, and the only thing they
      ever complain about is that their toes get cold.&rdquo; They worked without
      hesitation from twelve to fourteen hours a day, or a night, for seven days
      a week, and with the voluntary sacrifice of public holidays.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is not all, or nearly all, that the women of England did&mdash;I skip
      their welfare work, recreation work, nursing&mdash;but it is enough
      wherewith to answer the ignorant, or the fraud, or the fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      What did England do in the war, anyhow?
    </p>
    <p>
      On August 8, 1914, Lord Kitchener asked for 100,000 volunteers. He had
      them within fourteen days. In the first week of September 170,000 men
      enrolled, 30,000 in a single day. Eleven months later, two million had
      enlisted. Ten months later, five million and forty-one thousand had
      voluntarily enrolled in the Army and Navy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1914 Britain had in her Royal Naval Air Service 64 aeroplanes and 800
      airmen. In 1917 she had many thousand aeroplanes and 42,000 airmen. In her
      Royal Flying Corps she had in 1914, 66 planes and 100 men; in 1917,
      several thousand planes and men by tens of thousands. In the first nine
      months of 1917 British airmen brought down 876 enemy machines and drove
      down 759 out of control. From July, 1917, to June, 1918, 4102 enemy
      machines were destroyed or brought down with a loss of 1213 machines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides financing her own war costs she had by October, 1917, loaned eight
      hundred million dollars to the Dominions and five billion five hundred
      million to the Allies. She raised five billion in thirty days. In the
      first eight months of 1918 she contributed to the various forms of war
      loan at the average rate of one hundred and twenty-four million, eight
      hundred thousand a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is that enough? Enough to show what England did in the War? No, it is not
      enough for such people as continue to ask what she did. Nothing would
      suffice these persons. During the earlier stages of the War it was
      possible that the question could be asked honestly&mdash;though never
      intelligently&mdash;because the facts and figures were not at that time
      always accessible. They were still piling up, they were scattered about,
      mention of them was incidental and fugitive, they could be missed by
      anybody who was not diligently alert to find them. To-day it is quite
      otherwise. The facts and figures have been compiled, arranged, published
      in accessible and convenient form; therefore to-day, the man or woman who
      persists in asking what England did in the war is not honest but dishonest
      or mentally spotted, and does not want to be answered. They don&rsquo;t want to
      know. The question is merely a camouflage of their spite, and were every
      item given of the gigantic and magnificent contribution that England made
      to the defeat of the Kaiser and all his works, it would not stop their
      evil mouths. Not for them am I here setting forth a part of what England
      did; it is for the convenience of the honest American, who does want to
      know, that my collection of facts is made from the various sources which
      he may not have the time or the means to look up for himself. For his
      benefit I add some particulars concerning the British Navy which kept the
      Kaiser out of our front yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Admiral Mahan said in his book&mdash;and he was an American of whose
      knowledge and wisdom Congress seems to have known nothing and cared less&mdash;&ldquo;Why
      do English innate political conceptions of popular representative
      government, of the balance of law and liberty, prevail in North America
      from the Arctic Circle to the Gulf of Mexico, from the Atlantic to the
      Pacific? Because the command of the sea at the decisive era belonged to
      Great Britain.&rdquo; We have seen that the decisive era was when Napoleon&rsquo;s
      mouth watered for Louisiana, and when England took her stand behind the
      Monroe Doctrine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Admiral Sims said in the second installment of his narrative The Victory
      at Sea, published in The World&rsquo;s Work for October, 1919, at page 619: &ldquo;...
      Let us suppose for a moment that an earthquake, or some other great
      natural disturbance, had engulfed the British fleet at Scapa Flow. The
      world would then have been at Germany&rsquo;s mercy and all the destroyers the
      Allies could have put upon the sea would have availed them nothing, for
      the German battleships and battle cruisers could have sunk them or driven
      them into their ports. Then Allied commerce would have been the prey, not
      only of the submarines, which could have operated with the utmost freedom,
      but of the German surface craft as well. In a few weeks the British food
      supplies would have been exhausted. There would have been an early end to
      the soldiers and munitions which Britain was constantly sending to France.
      The United States could have sent no forces to the Western front, and the
      result would have been the surrender which the Allies themselves, in the
      spring of 1917, regarded as a not remote possibility. America would then
      have been compelled to face the German power alone, and to face it long
      before we had had an opportunity to assemble our resources and equip our
      armies. The world was preserved from all these calamities because the
      destroyer and the convoy solved the problem of the submarines, and because
      back of these agencies of victory lay Admiral Beatty&rsquo;s squadrons, holding
      at arm&rsquo;s length the German surface ships while these comparatively fragile
      craft were saving the liberties of the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes. The High Seas Fleet of Germany, costing her one billion five hundred
      million dollars, was bottled up. Five million five hundred thousand tons
      of German shipping and one million tons of Austrian shipping were driven
      off the seas or captured; oversea trade and oversea colonies were cut off.
      Two million oversea Huns of fighting age were hindered from joining the
      enemy. Ocean commerce and communication were stopped for the Huns and
      secured to the Allies. In 1916, 2100 mines were swept up and 89 mine
      sweepers lost. These mine sweepers and patrol boats numbered 12 in 1914,
      and 3300 by 1918. To patrol the seas British ships had to steam eight
      million miles in a single month. During the four years of the war they
      transported oversea more than thirteen million men (losing but 2700
      through enemy action) as well as transporting two million horses and
      mules, five hundred thousand vehicles, twenty-five million tons of
      explosives, fifty-one million tons of oil and fuel, one hundred and thirty
      million tons of food and other materials for the use of the Allies. In one
      month three hundred and fifty-five thousand men were carried from England
      to France.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after our present Secretary of the Navy, in his speech in Boston to
      which allusion has been made, had given our navy all and the British navy
      none of the credit of conveying our soldiers overseas, that Admiral Sims
      repaired the singular oblivion of the Secretary. We Americans should know
      the truth, he said. We had not been too accurately informed. We did not
      seem to have been told by anybody, for instance, that of the five thousand
      anti-submarine craft operating day and night in the infested waters, we
      had 160, or 3 per cent; that of the million and a half troops which had
      gone over from here in a few months, Great Britain brought over two thirds
      and escorted half.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would like American papers to pay particular attention to the fact that
      there are about 5000 anti-submarine craft in the ocean to-day, cutting out
      mines, escorting troop ships, and making it possible for us to go ahead
      and win this war. They can do this because the British Grand Fleet is so
      powerful that the German High Seas Fleet has to stay at home. The British
      Grand Fleet is the foundation stone of the cause of the whole of the
      Allies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus Admiral Sims.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is part of what England did in the war.

    </h2>
    <p>
      It may have been ten years ago, it may have been fifteen&mdash;and just
      how long it was before the war makes no matter&mdash;that I received an
      invitation to join a society for the promotion of more friendly relations
      between the United States and England.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; I said to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as I read the note, hostility rose in me. Refusal sprang to my lips
      before my reason had acted at all. I remembered George III. I remembered
      the Civil War. The ancient grudge, the anti-English complex, had been
      instantly set fermenting in me. Nothing could better disclose its lurking
      persistence than my virtually automatic exclamation, &ldquo;No, indeed!&rdquo; I knew
      something about England&rsquo;s friendly acts, about Venezuela, and Manila Bay,
      and Edmund Burke, and John Bright, and the Queen, and the Lancashire
      cotton spinners. And more than this historic knowledge, I knew living
      English people, men and women, among whom I counted dear and even beloved
      friends. I knew also, just as well as Admiral Mahan knew, and other
      Americans by the hundreds of thousands have known and know at this moment,
      that all the best we have and are&mdash;law, ethics, love of liberty&mdash;all
      of it came from England, grew in England first, ripened from the seed of
      which we are merely one great harvest, planted here by England. And yet I
      instantly exclaimed, &ldquo;No, indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, having been inflicted with the anti-English complex myself, I
      understand it all the better in others, and am begging them to counteract
      it as I have done. You will recollect that I said at the outset of these
      observations that, as I saw it, our prejudice was founded upon three
      causes fairly separate, although they often melted together. With two of
      these causes I have now dealt&mdash;the school histories, and certain acts
      and policies of England&rsquo;s throughout our relations with her. The third
      cause, I said, was certain traits of the English and ourselves which have
      produced personal friction. An American does or says something which
      angers an Englishman, who thereupon goes about thinking and saying, &ldquo;Those
      insufferable Yankees!&rdquo; An Englishman does or says something which angers
      an American, who thereupon goes about thinking and saying, &ldquo;To Hell with
      England!&rdquo; Each makes the well-nigh universal&mdash;but none the less
      perfectly ridiculous&mdash;blunder of damning a whole people because one
      of them has rubbed him the wrong way. Nothing could show up more forcibly
      and vividly this human weakness for generalizing from insufficient data,
      than the incident in London streets which I promised to tell you in full
      when we should reach the time for it. The time is now.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a hospital at no great distance from San Francisco, a wounded American
      soldier said to one who sat beside him, that never would he go to Europe
      to fight anybody again&mdash;except the English. Them he would like to
      fight; and to the astonished visitor he told his reason. He, it appeared,
      was one of our Americans who marched through London streets on that day
      when the eyes of London looked for the first time upon the Yankees at last
      arrived to bear a hand to England and her Allies. From the mob came a
      certain taunt: &ldquo;You silly ass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was, as you will observe, an unflattering interpretation of our
      national initials, U. S. A. Of course it was enough to make a proper
      American doughboy entirely &ldquo;hot under the collar.&rdquo; To this reading of our
      national initials our national readiness retorted in kind at an early
      date: A. E. F. meant After England Failed. But why, months and months
      afterwards, when everything was over, did that foolish doughboy in the
      hospital hug this lone thing to his memory? It was the act of an
      unthinking few. Didn&rsquo;t he notice what the rest of London was doing that
      day? Didn&rsquo;t he remember that she flew the Union Jack and the Stars and
      Stripes together from every symbolic pinnacle of creed and government that
      rose above her continent of streets and dwellings to the sky? Couldn&rsquo;t he
      feel that England, his old enemy and old mother, bowed and stricken and
      struggling, was opening her arms to him wide? She&rsquo;s a person who hides her
      tears even from herself; but it seems to me that, with a drop of
      imagination and half a drop of thought, he might have discovered a year
      and a half after a few street roughs had insulted him, that they were not
      all England. With two drops of thought it might even have ultimately
      struck him that here we came, late, very late, indeed, only just in time,
      from a country untouched, unafflicted, unbombed, safe, because of
      England&rsquo;s ships, to tired, broken, bleeding England; and that the sight of
      us, so jaunty, so fresh, so innocent of suffering and bereavement, should
      have been for a thoughtless moment galling to unthinking brains?
    </p>
    <p>
      I am perfectly sure that if such considerations as these were laid before
      any American soldier who still smarted under that taunt in London streets,
      his good American sense, which is our best possession, would grasp and
      accept the thing in its true proportions. He wouldn&rsquo;t want to blot an
      Empire out because a handful of muckers called him names. Of this I am
      perfectly sure, because in Paris streets it was my happy lot four months
      after the Armistice to talk with many American soldiers, among whom some
      felt sore about the French. Not one of these but saw with his good
      American sense, directly I pointed certain facts out to him, that his
      hostile generalization had been unjust. But, to quote the oft-quoted Mr.
      Kipling, that is another story.
    </p>
    <p>
      An American regiment just arrived in France was encamped for purposes of
      training and experience next a British regiment come back from the front
      to rest. The streets of the two camps were adjacent, and the Tommies
      walked out to watch the Yankees pegging down their tents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;wot a shyme you&rsquo;ve brought nobody along to tuck you in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They made other similar remarks; commented unfavorably upon the alignment;
      &ldquo;You were a bit late in coming,&rdquo; they said. Of course our boys had
      answers, and to these the Tommies had further answers, and this encounter
      of wits very naturally led to a result which could not possibly have been
      happier. I don&rsquo;t know what the Tommies expected the Yankees to do. I
      suppose they were as ignorant of our nature as we of theirs, and that they
      entertained preconceived notions. They suddenly found that we were, once
      again to quote Mr. Kipling, &ldquo;bachelors in barricks most remarkable like&rdquo;
       themselves. An American first sergeant hit a British first sergeant.
      Instantly a thousand men were milling. For thirty minutes they kept at it.
      Warriors reeled together and fell and rose and got it in the neck and the
      jaw and the eye and the nose&mdash;and all the while the British and
      American officers, splendidly discreet, saw none of it. British soldiers
      were carried back to their streets, still fighting, bunged Yankees
      staggered everywhere&mdash;but not an officer saw any of it. Black eyes
      the next day, and other tokens, very plainly showed who had been at this
      party. Thereafter a much better feeling prevailed between Tommies and
      Yanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      A more peaceful contact produced excellent consequences at an encampment
      of Americans in England. The Americans had brought over an idea,
      apparently, that the English were &ldquo;easy.&rdquo; They tried it on in sundry ways,
      but ended by the discovery that, while engaged upon this enterprise, they
      had been in sundry ways quite completely &ldquo;done&rdquo; themselves. This gave them
      a respect for their English cousins which they had never felt before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is another tale, similar in moral. This occurred at Brest, in France.
      In the Y hut sat an English lady, one of the hostesses. To her came a
      young American marine with whom she already had some acquaintance. This
      led him to ask for her advice. He said to her that as his permission was
      of only seventy-two hours, he wanted to be as economical of his time as he
      could and see everything best worth while for him to see during his leave.
      Would she, therefore, tell him what things in Paris were the most
      interesting and in what order he had best take them? She replied with
      another suggestion; why not, she said, ask for permission for England?
      This would give him two weeks instead of seventy-two hours. At this he
      burst out violently that he would not set foot in England; that he never
      wanted to have anything to do with England or with the English: &ldquo;Why, I am
      a marine!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;and we marines would sooner knock down any
      English sailor than speak to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The English lady, naturally, did not then tell him her nationality. She
      now realized that he had supposed her to be American, because she had
      frequently been in America and had talked to him as no stranger to the
      country could. She, of course, did not urge his going to England; she
      advised him what to see in France. He took his leave of seventy-two hours
      and when he returned was very grateful for the advice she had given him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw him often after this, and he grew to rely very much upon her
      friendly counsel. Finally, when the time came for her to go away from
      Brest, she told him that she was English. And then she said something like
      this to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, you told me you had never been in England and had never known an
      English person in your life, and yet you had all these ideas against us
      because somebody had taught you wrong. It is not at all your fault. You
      are only nineteen years old and you cannot read about us, because you have
      no chance; but at least you do know one English person now, and that
      English person begs you, when you do have a chance to read and inform
      yourself of the truth, to find out what England really has been, and what
      she has really done in this war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The end of the story is that the boy, who had become devoted to her, did
      as she suggested. To-day she receives letters from him which show that
      nothing is left of his anti-English complex. It is another instance of how
      clearly our native American mind, if only the facts are given it, thinks,
      judges, and concludes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is for those of my countrymen who will never have this chance, never
      meet some one who can &ldquo;guide them to the facts&rdquo;, that I tell these things.
      Let them &ldquo;cut out the dope.&rdquo; At this very moment that I write&mdash;November
      24, 1919&mdash;the dope is being fed freely to all who are ready, whether
      through ignorance or through interested motives, to swallow it. The
      ancient grudge is being played up strong over the whole country in the
      interest of Irish independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ian Hay in his two books so timely and so excellent, Getting Together and
      The Oppressed English, could not be as unreserved, naturally, as I can be
      about those traits in my own countrymen which have, in the past at any
      rate, retarded English cordiality towards Americans. Of these I shall
      speak as plainly as I know how. But also, being an American and therefore
      by birth more indiscreet than Ian Hay, I shall speak as plainly as I know
      how of those traits in the English which have helped to keep warm our
      ancient grudge. Thus I may render both countries forever uninhabitable to
      me, but shall at least take with me into exile a character for strict, if
      disastrous, impartiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      I begin with an American who was traveling in an English train. It stopped
      somewhere, and out of the window he saw some buildings which interested
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you tell me what those are?&rdquo; he asked an Englishman, a stranger, who
      sat in the other corner of the compartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better ask the guard,&rdquo; said the Englishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since that brief dialogue, this American does not think well of the
      English.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, two interpretations of the Englishman&rsquo;s answer are possible. One is,
      that he didn&rsquo;t himself know, and said so in his English way. English talk
      is often very short, much shorter than ours. That is because they all
      understand each other, are much closer knit than we are. Behind them are
      generations of &ldquo;doing it&rdquo; in the same established way, a way that their
      long experience of life has hammered out for their own convenience, and
      which they like. We&rsquo;re not nearly so closely knit together here, save in
      certain spots, especially the old spots. In Boston they understand each
      other with very few words said. So they do in Charleston. But these spots
      of condensed and hoarded understanding lie far apart, are never confluent,
      and also differ in their details; while the whole of England is confluent,
      and the details have been slowly worked out through centuries of getting
      on together, and are accepted and observed exactly like the rules of a
      game.
    </p>
    <p>
      In America, if the American didn&rsquo;t know, he would have answered, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      know. I think you&rsquo;ll have to ask the conductor,&rdquo; or at any rate, his reply
      would have been longer than the Englishman&rsquo;s. But I am not going to accept
      the idea that the Englishman didn&rsquo;t know and said so in his brief usual
      way. It&rsquo;s equally possible that he did know. Then, you naturally ask, why
      in the name of common civility did he give such an answer to the American?
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe that I can tell you. He didn&rsquo;t know that my friend was an
      American, he thought he was an Englishman who had broken the rules of the
      game. We do have some rules here in America, only we have not nearly so
      many, they&rsquo;re much more stretchable, and it&rsquo;s not all of us who have
      learned them. But nevertheless a good many have.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose you were traveling in a train here, and the man next you, whose
      face you had never seen before, and with whom you had not yet exchanged a
      syllable, said: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your pet name for your wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wouldn&rsquo;t your immediate inclination be to say, &ldquo;What damned business is
      that of yours?&rdquo; or words to that general effect?
    </p>
    <p>
      But again, you most naturally object, there was nothing personal in my
      friend&rsquo;s question about the buildings. No; but that is not it. At the
      bottom, both questions are an invasion of the same deep-seated thing&mdash;the
      right to privacy. In America, what with the newspaper reporters and this
      and that and the other, the territory of a man&rsquo;s privacy has been lessened
      and lessened until very little of it remains; but most of us still do draw
      the line somewhere; we may not all draw it at the same place, but we do
      draw a line. The difference, then, between ourselves and the English in
      this respect is simply, that with them the territory of a man&rsquo;s privacy
      covers more ground, and different ground as well. An Englishman doesn&rsquo;t
      expect strangers to ask him questions of a guide-book sort. For all such
      questions his English system provides perfectly definite persons to
      answer. If you want to know where the ticket office is, or where to take
      your baggage, or what time the train goes, or what platform it starts
      from, or what towns it stops at, and what churches or other buildings of
      interest are to be seen in those towns, there are porters and guards and
      Bradshaws and guidebooks to tell you, and it&rsquo;s they whom you are expected
      to consult, not any fellow-traveler who happens to be at hand. If you ask
      him, you break the rules. Had my friend said: &ldquo;I am an American. Would you
      mind telling me what those buildings are?&rdquo; all would have gone well. The
      Englishman would have recognized (not fifty years ago, but certainly
      to-day) that it wasn&rsquo;t a question of rules between them, and would have at
      once explained&mdash;either that he didn&rsquo;t know, or that the buildings
      were such and such.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not, I beg, suppose for a moment that I am holding up the English way
      as better than our own&mdash;or worse. I am not making comparisons; I am
      trying to show differences. Very likely there are many points wherein we
      think the English might do well to borrow from us; and it is quite as
      likely that the English think we might here and there take a leaf from
      their book to our advantage. But I am not theorizing, I am not seeking to
      show that we manage life better or that they manage life better; the only
      moral that I seek to draw from these anecdotes is, that we should each
      understand and hence make allowance for the other fellow&rsquo;s way. You will
      admit, I am sure, be you American or English, that everybody has a right
      to his own way? The proverb &ldquo;When in Rome you must do as Rome does&rdquo; covers
      it, and would save trouble if we always obeyed it. The people who forget
      it most are they that go to Rome for the first time; and I shall give you
      both English and American examples of this presently. It is good to
      ascertain before you go to Rome, if you can, what Rome does do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have you never been mistaken for a waiter, or something of that sort?
      Perhaps you will have heard the anecdote about one of our ambassadors to
      England. All ambassadors, save ours, wear on formal occasions a
      distinguishing uniform, just as our army and navy officers do; it is
      convenient, practical, and saves trouble. But we have declared it menial,
      or despotic, or un-American, or something equally silly, and hence our
      ambassadors must wear evening dress resembling closely the attire of those
      who are handing the supper or answering the door-bell. An Englishman saw
      Mr. Choate at some diplomatic function, standing about in this evening
      costume, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call me a cab.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a cab,&rdquo; said Mr. Choate, obediently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus did he make known to the Englishman that he was not a waiter.
      Similarly in crowded hotel dining-rooms or crowded railroad stations have
      agitated ladies clutched my arm and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want a table for three,&rdquo; or &ldquo;When does the train go to Poughkeepsie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just as we in America have regular people to attend to these things, so do
      they in England; and as the English respect each other&rsquo;s right to privacy
      very much more than we do, they resent invasions of it very much more than
      we do. But, let me say again, they are likely to mind it only in somebody
      they think knows the rules. With those who don&rsquo;t know them it is
      different. I say this with all the more certainty because of a fairly
      recent afternoon spent in an English garden with English friends. The
      question of pronunciation came up. Now you will readily see that with them
      and their compactness, their great public schools, their two great
      Universities, and their great London, the one eternal focus of them all,
      both the chance of diversity in social customs and the tolerance of it
      must be far less than in our huge unfocused country. With us, Boston, New
      York, Philadelphia, Chicago, San Francisco, is each a centre. Here you can
      pronounce the word calm, for example, in one way or another, and it merely
      indicates where you come from. Departure in England from certain
      established pronunciations has another effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said one of my friends, &ldquo;one knows where to place anybody who
      says &lsquo;girl&rsquo;&rdquo; (pronouncing it as it is spelled).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s frightful,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;because I say &lsquo;girl&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but you are an American. It doesn&rsquo;t apply.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But had I been English, it would have been something like coming to dinner
      without your collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is why I think that, had my friend in the train begun his question
      about the buildings by saying that he was an American, the answer would
      have been different. Not all the English yet, but many more than there
      were fifty or even twenty years ago, have ceased to apply their rules to
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      About 1874 a friend of mine from New York was taken to a London Club. Into
      the room where he was came the Prince of Wales, who took out a cigar, felt
      for and found no matches, looked about, and there was a silence. My friend
      thereupon produced matches, struck one, and offered it to the Prince, who
      bowed, thanked him, lighted his cigar, and presently went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then an Englishman observed to my friend: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the thing for a
      commoner to offer a light to the Prince.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a commoner, I&rsquo;m an American,&rdquo; said my friend with perfect good
      nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever their rule may be to-day about the Prince and matches, as to us
      they have come to accept my friend&rsquo;s pertinent distinction: they don&rsquo;t
      expect us to keep or even to know their own set of rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, they surpass us in this, they make more allowances for us than we
      for them. They don&rsquo;t criticize Americans for not being English. Americans
      still constantly do criticize the English for not being Americans. Now,
      the measure in which you don&rsquo;t allow for the customs of another country is
      the measure of your own provincialism. I have heard some of our own
      soldiers express dislike of the English because of their coldness. The
      English are not cold; they are silent upon certain matters. But it is all
      there. Do you remember that sailor at Zeebrugge carrying the unconscious
      body of a comrade to safety, not sure yet if he were alive or dead, and
      stroking that comrade&rsquo;s head as he went, saying over and over, &ldquo;Did you
      think I would leave yer?&rdquo; We are more demonstrative, we spell things out
      which it is the way of the English to leave between the lines. But it is
      all there! Behind that unconciliating wall of shyness and reserve, beats
      and hides the warm, loyal British heart, the most constant heart in the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That phrase applies to many things in England besides offering a light to
      the Prince, or asking a fellow traveler what those buildings are; and I
      think that the Englishman&rsquo;s notion of his right to privacy lies at the
      bottom of quite a number of these things. You may lay some of them to
      snobbishness, to caste, to shyness, they may have various secondary
      origins; but I prefer to cover them all with the broader term, the right
      to privacy, because it seems philosophically to account for them and
      explain them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In May, 1915, an Oxford professor was in New York. A few years before this
      I had read a book of his which had delighted me. I met him at lunch, I had
      not known him before. Even as we shook hands, I blurted out to him my
      admiration for his book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was the whole of his reply. It made me laugh at myself, for I should
      have known better. I had often been in England and could have told anybody
      that you mustn&rsquo;t too abruptly or obviously refer to what the other fellow
      does, still less to what you do yourself. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t done.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a sort of
      indecent exposure. It&rsquo;s one of the invasions of the right to privacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In America, not everywhere but in many places, a man upon entering a club
      and seeing a friend across the room, will not hesitate to call out to him,
      &ldquo;Hullo, Jack!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hullo, George!&rdquo; or whatever. In England &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t
      done.&rdquo; The greeting would be conveyed by a short nod or a glance. To call
      out a man&rsquo;s name across a room full of people, some of whom may be total
      strangers, invades his privacy and theirs. Have you noticed how, in our
      Pullman parlor cars, a party sitting together, generally young women, will
      shriek their conversation in a voice that bores like a gimlet through the
      whole place? That is an invasion of privacy. In England &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t done.&rdquo;
       We shouldn&rsquo;t stand it in a theatre, but in parlor cars we do stand it. It
      is a good instance to show that the Englishman&rsquo;s right to privacy is
      larger than ours, and thus that his liberty is larger than ours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before leaving this point, which to my thinking is the cause of many
      frictions and misunderstandings between ourselves and the English, I
      mustn&rsquo;t omit to give instances of divergence, where an Englishman will
      speak of matters upon which we are silent, and is silent upon subjects of
      which we will speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may present a letter of introduction to an Englishman, and he wishes
      to be civil, to help you to have a good time. It is quite possible he may
      say something like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you had better know my sister Sophy. You mayn&rsquo;t like her. But her
      dinners are rather amusing. Of course the food&rsquo;s ghastly because she&rsquo;s the
      stingiest woman in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, many Americans (though less willing than the French)
      are willing to discuss creed, immortality, faith. There is nothing from
      which the Englishman more peremptorily recoils, although he hates well
      nigh as deeply all abstract discussion, or to be clever, or to have you be
      clever. An American friend of mine had grown tired of an Englishman who
      had been finding fault with one American thing after another. So he
      suddenly said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you tell me why you English when you enter your pews on Sunday
      always immediately smell your hats?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman stiffened. &ldquo;I refuse to discuss religious subjects with
      you,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be ponderous over this anecdote grieves me&mdash;but you may not know
      that orthodox Englishmen usually don&rsquo;t kneel, as we do, after reaching
      their pews; they stand for a moment, covering their faces with their
      well-brushed hats: with each nation the observance is the same, it is in
      the manner of the observing that we differ.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much is said about our &ldquo;common language,&rdquo; and its being a reason for our
      understanding each other. Yes; but it is also almost as much a cause for
      our misunderstanding each other. It is both a help and a trap. If we
      Americans spoke something so wholly different from English as French is,
      comparisons couldn&rsquo;t be made; and somebody has remarked that comparisons
      are odious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you call your luggage baggage?&rdquo; says the Englishman&mdash;or used
      to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you call your baggage luggage?&rdquo; says the American&mdash;or used to
      say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you say treacle?&rdquo; inquires the Englishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because we call it molasses,&rdquo; answers the American.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How absurd to speak of a car when you mean a carriage!&rdquo; exclaims the
      Englishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t mean a carriage, we mean a car,&rdquo; retorts the American.
    </p>
    <p>
      You, my reader, may have heard (or perhaps even held) foolish
      conversations like that; and you will readily perceive that if we didn&rsquo;t
      say &ldquo;car&rdquo; when we spoke of the vehicle you get into when you board a
      train, but called it a voiture, or something else quite &ldquo;foreign,&rdquo; the
      Englishman would not feel that we had taken a sort of liberty with his
      mother-tongue. A deep point lies here: for most English the world is
      divided into three peoples, English, foreigners, and Americans; and for
      most of us likewise it is divided into Americans, foreigners, and English.
      Now a &ldquo;foreigner&rdquo; can call molasses whatever he pleases; we do not feel
      that he has taken any liberty with our mother-tongue; his tongue has a
      different mother; he can&rsquo;t help that; he&rsquo;s not to be criticized for that.
      But we and the English speak a tongue that has the same mother. This
      identity in pedigree has led and still leads to countless family discords.
      I&rsquo;ve not a doubt that divergences in vocabulary and in accent were the
      fount and origin of some swollen noses, some battered eyes, when our
      Yankees mixed with the Tommies. Each would be certain to think that the
      other couldn&rsquo;t &ldquo;talk straight&rdquo;&mdash;and each would be certain to say so.
      I shall not here spin out a list of different names for the same things
      now current in English and American usage: molasses and treacle will
      suffice for an example; you will be able easily to think of others, and
      there are many such that occur in everyday speech. Almost more tricky are
      those words which both peoples use alike, but with different meanings. I
      shall spin no list of these either; one example there is which I cannot
      name, of two words constantly used in both countries, each word quite
      proper in one country, while in the other it is more than improper. Thirty
      years ago I explained this one evening to a young Englishman who was here
      for a while. Two or three days later, he thanked me fervently for the
      warning: it had saved him, during a game of tennis, from a frightful
      shock, when his partner, a charming girl, meaning to tell him to cheer up,
      had used the word that is so harmless with us and in England so far beyond
      the pale of polite society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite as much as words, accent also leads to dissension. I have heard many
      an American speak of the English accent as &ldquo;affected&rdquo;; and our accent
      displeases the English. Now what Englishman, or what American, ever
      criticizes a Frenchman for not pronouncing our language as we do? His
      tongue has a different mother!
    </p>
    <p>
      I know not how in the course of the years all these divergences should
      have come about, and none of us need care. There they are. As a matter of
      fact, both England and America are mottled with varying accents literate
      and illiterate; equally true it is that each nation has its notion of the
      other&rsquo;s way of speaking&mdash;we&rsquo;re known by our shrill nasal twang, they
      by their broad vowels and hesitation; and quite as true is it that not all
      Americans and not all English do in their enunciation conform to these
      types.
    </p>
    <p>
      One May afternoon in 1919 I stopped at Salisbury to see that beautiful
      cathedral and its serene and gracious close. &ldquo;Star-scattered on the
      grass,&rdquo; and beneath the noble trees, lay New Zealand soldiers, solitary or
      in little groups, gazing, drowsing, talking at ease. Later, at the inn I
      was shown to a small table, where sat already a young Englishman in
      evening dress, at his dinner. As I sat down opposite him, I bowed, and he
      returned it. Presently we were talking. When I said that I was stopping
      expressly to see the cathedral, and how like a trance it was to find a
      scene so utterly English full of New Zealanders lying all about, he looked
      puzzled. It was at this, or immediately after this, that I explained to
      him my nationality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have known it,&rdquo; he remarked, after an instant&rsquo;s pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pressed him for his reason, which he gave; somewhat reluctantly, I
      think, but with excellent good-will. Of course it was the same old
      mother-tongue!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that I haven&rsquo;t happened to say &lsquo;I guess,&rsquo; and that I
      don&rsquo;t, perhaps, talk through my nose? But we don&rsquo;t all do that. We do all
      sorts of things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stuck to it. &ldquo;You talk like us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t mean to talk like anybody!&rdquo; I sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This diverted him, and brought us closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And see here,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;I knew you were English, although you&rsquo;ve not
      dropped a single h.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;dropping h&rsquo;s&mdash;that&rsquo;s&mdash;that&rsquo;s not&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Neither is talking through your nose. And we
      don&rsquo;t all say &lsquo;Amurrican.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he stuck to it. &ldquo;All the same there is an American voice. The train
      yesterday was full of it. Officers. Unmistakable.&rdquo; And he shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this we got on better than ever; and as he went his way, he gave me
      some advice about the hotel. I should do well to avoid the reading room.
      The hotel went in rather too much for being old-fashioned. Ran it into the
      ground. Tiresome. Good-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently I shall disclose more plainly to you the moral of my Salisbury
      anecdote.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it their discretion, do you think, that closes the lips of the French
      when they visit our shores? Not from the French do you hear prompt
      aspersions as to our differences from them. They observe that proverb
      about being in Rome: they may not be able to do as Rome does, but they do
      not inquire why Rome isn&rsquo;t like Paris. If you ask them how they like our
      hotels or our trains, they may possibly reply that they prefer their own,
      but they will hardly volunteer this opinion. But the American in England
      and the Englishman in America go about volunteering opinions. Are the
      French more discreet? I believe that they are; but I wonder if there is
      not also something else at the bottom of it. You and I will say things
      about our cousins to our aunt. Our aunt would not allow outsiders to say
      those things. Is it this, the-members-of-the-family principle, which makes
      us less discreet than the French? Is it this, too, which leads us by a
      seeming paradox to resent criticism more when it comes from England? I
      know not how it may be with you; but with me, when I pick up the paper and
      read that the Germans are calling us pig-dogs again, I am merely amused.
      When I read French or Italian abuse of us, I am sorry, to be sure; but
      when some English paper jumps on us, I hate it, even when I know that what
      it says isn&rsquo;t true. So here, if I am right in my members-of-the-family
      hypothesis, you have the English and ourselves feeling free to be
      disagreeable to each other because we are relations, and yet feeling
      especially resentful because it&rsquo;s a relation who is being disagreeable. I
      merely put the point to you, I lay no dogma down concerning members of the
      family; but I am perfectly sure that discretion is a quality more common
      to the French than to ourselves or our relations: I mean something a
      little more than discretion, I mean esprit de conduits, for which it is
      hard to find a translation.

    <p>
      Upon my first two points, the right to privacy and the mother-tongue, I
      have lingered long, feeling these to be not only of prime importance and
      wide application, but also to be quite beyond my power to make lucid in
      short compass. I trust that they have been made lucid. I must now get on
      to further anecdotes, illustrating other and less subtle causes of
      misunderstanding; and I feel somewhat like the author of Don Juan when he
      exclaims that he almost wishes he had ne&rsquo;er begun that very remarkable
      poem. I renounce all pretense to the French virtue of discretion.

      Evening dress has been the source of many irritations. Englishmen did not
      appear to think that they need wear it at American dinner parties. There
      was a good deal of this at one time. During that period an Englishman, who
      had brought letters to a gentleman in Boston and in consequence had been
      asked to dinner, entered the house of his host in a tweed suit. His host,
      in evening dress of course, met him in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; said the Bostonian, &ldquo;that you haven&rsquo;t your dress suit with
      you. The man will take you upstairs and one of mine will fit you well
      enough. We&rsquo;ll wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In England, a cricketer from Philadelphia, after the match at Lord&rsquo;s, had
      been invited to dine at a great house with the rest of his eleven. They
      were to go there on a coach. The American discovered after arrival that he
      alone of the eleven had not brought a dress suit with him. He asked his
      host what he was to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I advise you to go home,&rdquo; said the host.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moral here is not that all hosts in England would have treated a guest
      so, or that all American hosts would have met the situation so well as
      that Boston gentleman: but too many English used to be socially brutal&mdash;quite
      as much so to each other as to us, or any one. One should bear that in
      mind. I know of nothing more English in its way than what Eton answered to
      Beaumont (I think) when Beaumont sent a challenge to play cricket: &ldquo;Harrow
      we know, and Rugby we have heard of. But who are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That sort of thing belongs rather to the Palmerston days than to these;
      belongs to days that were nearer in spirit to the Waterloo of 1815, which
      a haughty England won, than to the Waterloo of 1914-18, which a humbler
      England so nearly lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turn we next the other way for a look at ourselves. An American lady who
      had brought a letter of introduction to an Englishman in London was in
      consequence asked to lunch. He naturally and hospitably gathered to meet
      her various distinguished guests. Afterwards she wrote him that she wished
      him to invite her to lunch again, as she had matters of importance to tell
      him. Why, then, didn&rsquo;t she ask him to lunch with her? Can you see? I think
      I do.
    </p>
    <p>
      An American lady was at a house party in Scotland at which she met a
      gentleman of old and famous Scotch blood. He was wearing the kilt of his
      clan. While she talked with him she stared, and finally burst out
      laughing. &ldquo;I declare,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s positively the most ridiculous
      thing I ever saw a man dressed in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the Savoy hotel in August, 1914, when England declared war upon
      Germany, many American women made scenes of confusion and vociferation.
      About England and the blast of Fate which had struck her they had nothing
      to say, but crowded and wailed of their own discomforts, meals, rooms,
      every paltry personal inconvenience to which they were subjected, or
      feared that they were going to be subjected. Under the unprecedented
      stress this was, perhaps, not unnatural; but it would have seemed less
      displeasing had they also occasionally showed concern for England&rsquo;s plight
      and peril.

      An American, this time a man (our crudities are not limited to the sex)
      stood up in a theatre, disputing the sixpence which you always have to pay
      for your program in the London theatres. He disputed so long that many
      people had to stand waiting to be shown their seats.
    </p>
    <p>
      During deals at a game of bridge on a Cunard steamer, the talk had turned
      upon a certain historic house in an English county. The talk was friendly,
      everything had been friendly each day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said a very rich American to his English partner in the game,
      &ldquo;those big estates will all be ours pretty soon. We&rsquo;re going to buy them
      up and turn your island into our summer resort.&rdquo; No doubt this millionaire
      intended to be playfully humorous.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a table where several British and one American&mdash;an officer&mdash;sat
      during another ocean voyage between Liverpool and Halifax in June, 1919,
      the officer expressed satisfaction to be getting home again. He had gone
      over, he said, to &ldquo;clean up the mess the British had made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To a company of Americans who had never heard it before, was told the
      well-known exploit of an American girl in Europe. In an ancient church she
      was shown the tomb of a soldier who had been killed in battle three
      centuries ago. In his honor and memory, because he lost his life bravely
      in a great cause, his family had kept a little glimmering lamp alight ever
      since. It hung there, beside the tomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s never gone out in all this time?&rdquo; asked the American girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; she was told.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s out now, anyway,&rdquo; and she blew it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the Americans who heard this were shocked all but one, who said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think she was right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There you are! There you have us at our very worst! And with this plump
      specimen of the American in Europe at his very worst, I turn back to the
      English: only, pray do not fail to give those other Americans who were
      shocked by the outrage of the lamp their due. How wide of the mark would
      you be if you judged us all by the one who approved of that horrible
      vandal girl&rsquo;s act! It cannot be too often repeated that we must never
      condemn a whole people for what some of the people do.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the two-and-a-half anecdotes which follow, you must watch out for
      something which lies beneath their very obvious surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      An American sat at lunch with a great English lady in her country-house.
      Although she had seen him but once before, she began a conversation like
      this:
    </p>
    <p>
      Did the American know the van Squibbers?
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the van Squibbers, his hostess explained, were Americans who lived
      in London and went everywhere. One certainly did see them everywhere. They
      were almost too extraordinary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the American knew quite all about these van Squibbers. He knew also
      that in New York, and Boston, and Philadelphia, and in many other places
      where existed a society with still some ragged remnants of decency and
      decorum left, one would not meet this highly star-spangled family
      &ldquo;everywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hostess kept it up. Did the American know the Butteredbuns? No? Well,
      one met the Butteredbuns everywhere too. They were rather more
      extraordinary than the van Squibbers. And then there were the Cakewalks,
      and the Smith-Trapezes&rsquo; Mrs. Smith-Trapeze wasn&rsquo;t as extraordinary as her
      daughter&mdash;the one that put the live frog in Lord Meldon&rsquo;s soup&mdash;and
      of course neither of them were &ldquo;talked about&rdquo; in the same way that the
      eldest Cakewalk girl was talked about. Everybody went to them, of course,
      because one really never knew what one might miss if one didn&rsquo;t go. At
      length the American said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must correct me if I am wrong in an impression I have received.
      Vulgar Americans seem to me to get on very well in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hostess paused for a moment, and then she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is perfectly true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This acknowledgment was complete, and perfectly friendly, and after that
      all went better than it had gone before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The half anecdote is a part of this one, and happened a few weeks later at
      table&mdash;dinner this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting next to the same American was an English lady whose conversation
      led him to repeat to her what he had said to his hostess at lunch: &ldquo;Vulgar
      Americans seem to get on very well in London society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;and I will tell you why. We English&mdash;I
      mean that set of English&mdash;are blase. We see each other too much, we
      are all alike in our ways, and we are awfully tired of it. Therefore it
      refreshes us and amuses us to see something new and different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the American, &ldquo;you accept these hideous people&rsquo;s invitations,
      and go to their houses, and eat their food, and drink their champagne, and
      it&rsquo;s just like going to see the monkeys at the Zoo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; returned the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; the American asked, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t that awfully low down of you?&rdquo; (He
      smiled as he said it.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately the English lady assented; and grew more cordial. When next
      day the party came to break up, she contrived in the manner of her
      farewell to make the American understand that because of their
      conversation she bore him not ill will but good will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more, the scene of my anecdote is at table, a long table in a club,
      where men came to lunch. All were Englishmen, except a single stranger. He
      was an American, who through the kindness of one beloved member of that
      club, no longer living now, had received a card to the club. The American,
      upon sitting down alone in this company, felt what I suppose that many of
      us feel in like circumstances: he wished there were somebody there who
      knew him and could nod to him. Nevertheless, he was spoken to, asked
      questions about various of his fellow countrymen, and made at home.
      Presently, however, an elderly member who had been silent and whom I will
      designate as being of the Dr. Samuel Johnson type, said: &ldquo;You seem to be
      having trouble in your packing houses over in America?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very disgraceful, those exposures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were. It was May, 1906.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Government seems to be doing something about it. It&rsquo;s certainly
      scandalous. Such abuses should never have been possible in the first
      place. It oughtn&rsquo;t to require your Government to stop it. It shouldn&rsquo;t
      have started.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy the facts aren&rsquo;t quite so bad as that sensational novel about
      Chicago makes them out,&rdquo; said the American. &ldquo;At least I have been told
      so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It all sounds characteristic to me,&rdquo; said the Sam Johnson. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite
      the sort of thing one expects to hear from the States.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is characteristic,&rdquo; said the American. &ldquo;In spite of all the years that
      the sea has separated us, we&rsquo;re still inveterately like you, a bullying,
      dishonest lot&mdash;though we&rsquo;ve had nothing quite so bad yet as your
      opium trade with China.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Sam Johnson said no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a ranch in Wyoming were a number of Americans and one Englishman, a man
      of note, bearing a celebrated name. He was telling the company what one
      could do in the way of amusement in the evening in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if there&rsquo;s nothing at the theatres and everything else fails, you can
      always go to one of the restaurants and hear the Americans eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There you have them, my anecdotes. They are chosen from many. I hope and
      believe that, between them all, they cover the ground; that, taken
      together as I want you to take them after you have taken them singly, they
      make my several points clear. As I see it, they reveal the chief whys and
      wherefores of friction between English and Americans. It is also my hope
      that I have been equally disagreeable to everybody. If I am to be banished
      from both countries, I shall try not to pass my exile in Switzerland,
      which is indeed a lovely place, but just now too full of celebrated
      Germans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond my two early points, the right to privacy and the mother-tongue,
      what are the generalizations to be drawn from my data? I should like to
      dodge spelling them out, I should immensely prefer to leave it here. Some
      readers know it already, knew it before I began; while for others, what
      has been said will be enough. These, if they have the will to friendship
      instead of the will to hate, will get rid of their anti-English complex,
      supposing that they had one, and understand better in future what has not
      been clear to them before. But I seem to feel that some readers there may
      be who will wish me to be more explicit.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, then. England has a thousand years of greatness to her credit. Who
      would not be proud of that? Arrogance is the seamy side of pride. That is
      what has rubbed us Americans the wrong way. We are recent. Our thousand
      years of greatness are to come. Such is our passionate belief. Crudity is
      the seamy side of youth. Our crudity rubs the English the wrong way.
      Compare the American who said we were going to buy England for a summer
      resort with the Englishman who said that when all other entertainment in
      London failed, you could always listen to the Americans eat. Crudity,
      &ldquo;freshness&rdquo; on our side, arrogance, toploftiness on theirs: such is one
      generalization I would have you disengage from my anecdotes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second. The English are blunter than we. They talk to us as they would
      talk to themselves. The way we take it reveals that we are too often
      thin-skinned. Recent people are apt to be thin-skinned and self-conscious
      and self-assertive, while those with a thousand years of tradition would
      have thicker hides and would never feel it necessary to assert themselves.
      Give an Englishman as good as he gives you, and you are certain to win his
      respect, and probably his regard. In this connection see my anecdote about
      the Tommies and Yankees who physically fought it out, and compare it with
      the Salisbury, the van Squibber, and the opium trade anecdotes. &ldquo;Treat &lsquo;em
      rough,&rdquo; when they treat you rough: they like it. Only, be sure you do it
      in the right way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Third. We differ because we are alike. That American who stood in the
      theatre complaining about the sixpence he didn&rsquo;t have to pay at home is
      exactly like Englishmen I have seen complaining about the unexpected here.
      We share not only the same mother-tongue, we share every other fundamental
      thing upon which our welfare rests and our lives are carried on. We like
      the same things, we hate the same things. We have the same notions about
      justice, law, conduct; about what a man should be, about what a woman
      should be. It is like the mother-tongue we share, yet speak with a
      difference. Take the mother-tongue for a parable and symbol of all the
      rest. Just as the word &ldquo;girl&rdquo; is identical to our sight but not to our
      hearing, and means oh! quite the same thing throughout us all in all its
      meanings, so that identity of nature which we share comes often to the
      surface in different guise. Our loquacity estranges the Englishman, his
      silence estranges us. Behind that silence beats the English heart, warm,
      constant, and true; none other like it on earth, except our own at its
      best, beating behind our loquacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus far my anecdotes carry me. May they help some reader to a better
      understanding of what he has misunderstood heretofore!
    </p>
    <p>
      No anecdotes that I can find (though I am sure that they are to be found)
      will illustrate one difference between the two peoples, very noticeable
      to-day. It is increasing. An Englishman not only sticks closer than a
      brother to his own rights, he respects the rights of his neighbor just as
      strictly. We Americans are losing our grip on this. It is the bottom of
      the whole thing. It is the moral keystone of democracy. Howsoever we may
      talk about our own rights to-day, we pay less and less respect to those of
      our neighbors. The result is that to-day there is more liberty in England
      than here. Liberty consists and depends upon respecting your neighbor&rsquo;s
      rights every bit as fairly and squarely as your own.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, I wonder if the English are as good losers as we are?
      Hardly anything that they could do would rub us more the wrong way than to
      deny to us that fair play in sport which they accord each other. I shall
      not more than mention the match between our Benicia Boy and their Tom
      Sayers. Of this the English version is as defective as our school-book
      account of the Revolution. I shall also pass over various other
      international events that are somewhat well known, and I will illustrate
      the point with an anecdote known to but a few.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crossing the ocean were some young English and Americans, who got up an
      international tug-of-war. A friend of mine was anchor of our team. We
      happened to win. They didn&rsquo;t take it very well. One of them said to the
      anchor:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know why you pulled us over the line?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you had all the blackguards on your side of the line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know why we had all the blackguards on our side of the line?&rdquo;
       inquired the American.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because we pulled you over the line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In one of my anecdotes I used the term Sam Johnson to describe an
      Englishman of a certain type. Dr. Samuel Johnson was a very marked
      specimen of the type, and almost the only illustrious Englishman of
      letters during our Revolutionary troubles who was not our friend. Right
      down through the years ever since, there have been Sam Johnsons writing
      and saying unfavorable things about us. The Tory must be eternal, as much
      as the Whig or Liberal; and both are always needed. There will probably
      always be Sam Johnsons in England, just like the one who was scandalized
      by our Chicago packing-house disclosures. No longer ago than June 1, 1919,
      a Sam Johnson, who was discussing the Peace Treaty, said in my hearing, in
      London:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Yankees shouldn&rsquo;t have been brought into any consultation. They aided
      and abetted Germany.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In Littell&rsquo;s Living Age of July 20, 1918, pages 151-160, you may read an
      interesting account of British writers on the United States. The bygone
      ones were pretty preposterous. They satirized the newness of a new
      country. It was like visiting the Esquimaux and complaining that they grew
      no pineapples and wore skins. In Littell you will find how few are the
      recent Sam Johnsons as compared with the recent friendly writers. You will
      also be reminded that our anti-English complex was discerned generations
      ago by Washington Irving. He said in his Sketch Book that writers in this
      country were &ldquo;instilling anger and resentment into the bosom of a youthful
      nation, to grow with its growth and to strengthen with its strength.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he quotes from the English Quarterly Review, which in that early day
      already wrote of America and England:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a sacred bond between us by blood and by language which no
      circumstances can break.... Nations are too ready to admit that they have
      natural enemies; why should they be less willing to believe that they have
      natural friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is we ourselves to-day, not England, that are pushing friendship away.
      It is our politicians, papers, and propagandists who are making the
      trouble and the noise. In England the will to friendship rules, has ruled
      for a long while. Does the will to hate rule with us? Do we prefer
      Germany? Do we prefer the independence of Ireland to the peace of the
      world?

    <h2>
      Chapter XVI: An International Imposture
    </h2>
    <p>
      A part of the Irish is asking our voice and our gold to help independence
      for the whole of the Irish. Independence is not desired by the whole of
      the Irish. Irishmen of Ulster have plainly said so. Everybody knows this.
      Roman Catholics themselves are not unanimous. Only some of them desire
      independence. These, known as Sinn Fein, appeal to us for deliverance from
      their conqueror and oppressor; they dwell upon the oppression of England
      beneath which Ireland is now crushed. They refer to England&rsquo;s brutal and
      unjustifiable conquest of the Irish nation seven hundred and forty-eight
      years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is the truth, what are the facts?
    </p>
    <p>
      By his bull &ldquo;Laudabiliter,&rdquo; in 1155, Pope Adrian the Fourth invited the
      King of England to take charge of Ireland. In 1172 Pope Alexander the
      Third confirmed this by several letters, at present preserved in the Black
      Book of the Exchequer. Accordingly, Henry the Second went to Ireland. All
      the archbishops and bishops of Ireland met him at Waterford, received him
      as king and lord of Ireland, vowing loyal obedience to him and his
      successors, and acknowledging fealty to them forever. These prelates were
      followed by the kings of Cork, Limerick, Ossory, Meath, and by Reginald of
      Waterford. Roderick O&rsquo;Connor, King of Connaught, joined them in 1175. All
      these accepted Henry the Second of England as their Lord and King,
      swearing to be loyal to him and his successors forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was England&rsquo;s brutal and unjustifiable conquest of Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ireland was not a nation, it was a tribal chaos. The Irish nation of that
      day is a legend, a myth, built by poetic imagination. During the centuries
      succeeding Henry the Second, were many eras of violence and bloodshed. In
      reading the story, it is hard to say which side committed the most crimes.
      During those same centuries, violence and bloodshed and oppression existed
      everywhere in Europe. Undoubtedly England was very oppressive to Ireland
      at times; but since the days of Gladstone she has steadily endeavored to
      relieve Ireland, with the result that today she is oppressing Ireland
      rather less than our Federal Government is oppressing Massachusetts, or
      South Carolina, or any State. By the Wyndham Land Act of 1903, Ireland was
      placed in a position so advantageous, so utterly the reverse of
      oppression, that Dillon, the present leader, hastened to obstruct the
      operation of the Act, lest the Irish genius for grievance might perish
      from starvation. Examine the state of things for yourself, I cannot swell
      this book with the details; they are as accessible to you as the few facts
      about the conquest which I have just narrated. Examine the facts, but even
      without examining them, ask yourself this question: With Canada,
      Australia, and all those other colonies that I have named above, satisfied
      with England&rsquo;s rule, hastening to her assistance, and with only Ireland
      selling herself to Germany, is it not just possible that something is the
      matter with Ireland rather than with England? Sinn Fein will hear of no
      Home Rule. Sinn Fein demands independence. Independence Sinn Fein will not
      get. Not only because of the outrage to unconsenting Ulster, but also
      because Britain, having just got rid of one Heligoland to the East, will
      not permit another to start up on the West. As early as August 25th, 1914,
      mention in German papers was made of the presence in Berlin of Casement
      and of his mission to invite Germany to step into Ireland when England was
      fighting Germany. The traffic went steadily on from that time, and broke
      out in the revolution and the crimes in Dublin in 1916. England discovered
      the plan of the revolution just in time to foil the landing in Ireland of
      Germany, whom Ireland had invited there. Were England seeking to break
      loose from Ireland, she could sue Ireland for a divorce and name the
      Kaiser as co-respondent. Any court would grant it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The part of Ireland which does not desire independence, which desires it
      so little that it was ready to resist Home Rule by force in 1914, is the
      steady, thrifty, clean, coherent, prosperous part of Ireland. It is the
      other, the unstable part of Ireland, which has declared Ireland to be a
      Republic. For convenience I will designate this part as Green Ireland, and
      the thrifty, stable part as Orange Ireland. So when our politicians
      sympathize with an &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; Republic, they befriend merely Green Ireland;
      they offend Orange Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Americans are being told in these days that they owe a debt of support to
      Irish independence, because the &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; fought with us in our own struggle
      for Independence. Yes, the Irish did, and we do owe them a debt of
      support. But it was the Orange Irish who fought in our Revolution, not the
      Green Irish. Therefore in paying the debt to the Green Irish and clamoring
      for &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; independence, we are double crossing the Orange Irish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a curious fact that in the Revolutionary War the Germans and
      Catholic Irish should have furnished the bulk of the auxiliaries to the
      regular English soldiers;... The fiercest and most ardent Americans of
      all, however, were the Presbyterian Irish settlers and their descendants.&rdquo;
       History of New York, p. 133, by Theodore Roosevelt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, in what manner have the Green Irish incurred our thanks?
    </p>
    <p>
      They made the ancient and honorable association of Tammany their own. Once
      it was American. Now Tammany is Green Irish. I do not believe that I need
      pause to tell you much about Tammany. It defeated Mitchel, a loyal but
      honest Catholic, and the best Mayor of Near York in thirty years. It is a
      despotism built on corruption and fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      During our Civil War, it was the Green Irish that resisted the draft in
      New York. They would not fight. You have heard of the draft riots in New
      York in 1862. They would not fight for the Confederacy either.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the following decade, in Pennsylvania, an association, called the
      Molly Maguires, terrorized the coal regions until their reign of
      assassination was brought to an end by the detection, conviction, and
      execution of their ringleaders. These were Green Irish.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Cork and Queenstown during the recent war, our American sailors were
      assaulted and stoned by the Green Irish, because they had come to help
      fight Germany. These assaults, and the retaliations to which they led,
      became so serious that no naval men under the rank of Commander were
      permitted to go to Cork. Leading citizens of Cork came to beg that this
      order be rescinded. But, upon being cross-examined, it was found that the
      Green Irish who had made the trouble had never been punished. Of this many
      of us had news before Admiral Sims in The World&rsquo;s Work for November, pages
      63-64, gave it his authoritative confirmation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking one consideration with another, it hardly seems to me that our debt
      to the Green Irish is sufficiently heavy for us to hinder England for the
      sake of helping them and Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not all the Green Irish were guilty of the attacks upon our sailors; not
      all by any means were pro-German; and I know personally of loyal Roman
      Catholics who are wholly on England&rsquo;s side, and are wholly opposed to Sinn
      Fein. Many such are here, many in Ireland: them I do not mean. It is Sinn
      Fein that I mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1918, when England with her back to the wall was fighting Germany, the
      Green Irish killed the draft. Here following, I give some specific
      instances of what the Roman Catholic priests said.
    </p>
    <p>
      April 21st. After mass at Castletown, Bear Haven, Father Brennan ordered
      his flock to resist conscription, take the sacrament, and to be ready to
      resist to the death; such death insuring the full benediction of God and
      his Church. If the police resort to force, let the people kill the police
      as they would kill any one who threatened their lives. If soldiers came in
      support of the draft, let them be treated like the police. Policemen and
      soldiers dying in their attempt to carry out the draft law, would die the
      enemies of God, while the people who resisted them would die in peace with
      God and under the benediction of his Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father Lynch said in church at Ryehill: &ldquo;Resist the draft by every means
      in your power. Any minion of the English Government who fires upon you,
      above all if he is a Catholic, commits a mortal sin and God will punish
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the chapel at Kilgarvan Father Murphy said: &ldquo;Every Irishman who helps
      to apply the draft in Ireland is not only a traitor to his country, but
      commits a mortal sin against God&rsquo;s law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At mass in Scariff the Rev. James MacInerney said: &ldquo;No Irish Catholic,
      whatever his station be, can help the draft in this country without
      denying his faith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      April 28th. After having given the communion to three hundred men in the
      church at Eyries, County Cork, Father Gerald Dennehy said: &ldquo;Any Catholic
      who either as policeman or as agent of the government shall assist in
      applying the draft, shall be excommunicated and cursed by the Roman
      Catholic Church. The curse of God will follow him in every land. You can
      kill him at sight, God will bless you and it will be the most acceptable
      sacrifice that you can offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Referring to any policeman who should attempt to enforce the draft, Father
      Murphy said at mass in Killenna, &ldquo;Any policeman who is killed in such
      attempt will be damned in hell, even if he was in a state of grace that
      very morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ninety-five percent of those Irish policemen were Catholics and had to
      respect the commands of those priests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ireland is England&rsquo;s business, not ours. But the word &ldquo;self-determination&rdquo;
       appears to hypnotize some Americans. We must not be hypnotized by this
      word. It is upon the &ldquo;principle&rdquo; expressed in this word that our
      sympathies with the Irish Republic are asked. The six northeastern
      counties of Ulster, on the &ldquo;principle&rdquo; of self-determination, should be
      separated from the Irish Republic. But the Green Irish will not listen to
      that. Protestants in Ulster had to listen in their own chief city to Sinn
      Fein rejoicings over German victories. The rebellion of 1916, when Sinn
      Fein opened the back door that England&rsquo;s enemies might enter and destroy
      her&mdash;this dastardly treason was made bloody by cowardly violence. The
      unarmed and the unsuspecting were shot down and stabbed in cold blood.
      Later, soldiers who came home from the front, wounded soldiers too, were
      persecuted and assaulted. The men of Ulster don&rsquo;t wish to fall under the
      power of the Green Irish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do not know whether the British statesmen are right in asserting a
      connection between Irish revolutionary feeling and German propaganda. But
      in such a connection we should see no sign of a bad German policy.&rdquo; Thus
      wrote a Prussian deputy in Das Grossere Deutschland. That was over there.
      This was over here:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fraternal understanding which unites the Ancient Order of Hibernians
      and the German-American Alliance receives our unqualified endorsement.
      This unity of effort in all matters of a public nature intended to
      circumvent the efforts of England to secure an Anglo-American alliance
      have been productive of very successful results. The congratulations of
      those of us who live under the flag of the United States are extended to
      our German-American fellow citizens upon the conquests won by the
      fatherland, and we assure them of our unshaken confidence that the German
      Empire will crush England and aid in the liberation of Ireland, and be a
      real defender of small nations.&rdquo; See the Boston Herald of July 22, 1916.
    </p>
    <p>
      During our Civil War, in 1862, a resolution of sympathy with the South was
      stifled in Parliament.
    </p>
    <p>
      On June 6, 1919, our Senate passed, with one dissenting voice, the
      following, offered by Senator Walsh, democrat, of Massachusetts:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Resolved, that the Senate of the United States express its sympathy with
      the aspirations of the Irish people for a government of its own choice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What England would not do for the South in 1862, we now do against England
      our ally, against Ulster, our friend in our Revolution, and in support of
      England&rsquo;s enemies, Sinn Fein and Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ireland has less than 4,500,000 inhabitants; Ulster&rsquo;s share is about one
      third, and its Protestants outnumber its Catholics by more than three
      fourths. Besides such reprisals as they saw wrought upon wounded soldiers,
      they know that the Green Irish who insist that Ulster belong to their
      Republic, do so because they plan to make prosperous and thrifty Ulster
      their milch cow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let every fair-minded American pause, then, before giving his sympathy to
      an independent Irish Republic on the principle of self-determination, or
      out of gratitude to the Green Irish. Let him remember that it was the
      Orange Irish who helped us in our Revolution, and that the Orange Irish do
      not want an independent Irish Republic. There will be none; our
      interference merely makes Germany happy and possibly prolongs the existing
      chaos; but there will be none. Before such loyal and thinking Catholics as
      the gentleman who said to me that word about &ldquo;spoiling the ship for a
      ha&rsquo;pennyworth of tar,&rdquo; and before a firm and coherent policy on England&rsquo;s
      part, Sinn Fein will fade like a poisonous mist.

    <h2>
      Chapter XVII: Paint
    </h2>
    <p>
      Soldiers of ours&mdash;many soldiers, I am sorry to say&mdash;have come
      back from Coblenz and other places in the black spot, saying that they
      found the inhabitants of the black spot kind and agreeable. They give this
      reason for liking the Germans better than they do the English. They found
      the Germans agreeable, the English not agreeable. Well, this amounts to
      something as far as it goes: but how far does it go, and how much does it
      amount to? Have you ever seen an automobile painted up to look like new,
      and it broke down before it had run ten miles, and you found its insides
      were wrong? Would you buy an automobile on the strength of the paint?
      England often needs paint, but her insides are all right. If our soldiers
      look no deeper than the paint, if our voters look no further than the
      paint, if our democracy never looks at anything but the paint, God help
      our democracy! Of course the Germans were agreeable to our soldiers after
      the armistice!
    </p>
    <p>
      Agreeable Germany!&mdash;who sank the Lusitania; who sank five thousand
      British merchant ships with the loss of fifteen thousand men, women, and
      children, all murdered at sea, without a chance for their lives; who fired
      on boat-loads of the shipwrecked, who stood on her submarine and laughed
      at the drowning passengers of the torpedoed Falaba.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disagreeable England!&mdash;who sank five hundred German ships without
      permitting a single life to be lost, who never fired a shot until
      provision had been made for the safety of passengers and crews.
    </p>
    <p>
      Agreeable Germany!&mdash;who, as she retreated, poisoned wells and gassed
      the citizens from whose village she was running away; who wrecked the
      churches and the homes of the helpless living, and bombed the tombs of the
      helpless dead; who wrenched families apart in the night, taking their boys
      to slavery and their girls to wholesale violation, leaving the old people
      to wander in loneliness and die; who in her raids upon England slaughtered
      three hundred and forty-two women, and killed or injured seven hundred and
      fifty-seven children, and made in all a list of four thousand five hundred
      and sixty-eight, bombed by her airmen; whose trained nurses met our
      wounded and captured men at the railroad trains and held out cups of water
      for them to see, and then poured them on the ground or spat in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disagreeable England!&mdash;whose colonies rushed to help her: Canada, who
      within eight weeks after war had been declared, came with a voluntary army
      of thirty-three thousand men; who stood her ground against that first
      meeting with the poison gas and saved not only the day, but possibly the
      whole cause; who by 1917 had sent over four hundred thousand men to help
      disagreeable England; who gave her wealth, her food, her substance; who
      poured every symbol of aid and love into disagreeable England&rsquo;s lap to
      help her beat agreeable Germany. Thus did all England&rsquo;s colonies offer and
      bring both themselves and their resources, from the smallest to the
      greatest; little Newfoundland, whose regiment gave such heroic account of
      itself at Gallipoli; Australia who came with her cruisers, and with also
      her armies to the West Front and in South Africa; New Zealand who came
      from the other side of the world with men and money&mdash;three million
      pounds in gift, not loan, from one million people. And the Boers? The
      Boers, who latest of all, not twenty years before, had been at war with
      England, and conquered by her, and then by her had been given a Boer
      Government. What did the Boers do? In spite of the Kaiser&rsquo;s telegram of
      sympathy, in spite of his plans and his hopes, they too, like Canada and
      New Zealand and all the rest, sided of their own free will with
      disagreeable England against agreeable Germany. They first stamped out a
      German rebellion, instigated in their midst, and then these Boers left
      their farms, and came to England&rsquo;s aid, and drove German power from
      Southwest Africa. And do you remember the wire that came from India to
      London? &ldquo;What orders from the King-Emperor for me and my men?&rdquo; These were
      the words of the Maharajah of Rewa; and thus spoke the rest of India. The
      troops she sent captured Neue Chapelle. From first to last they fought in
      many places for the Cause of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      What do words, or propaganda, what does anything count in the face of such
      facts as these?
    </p>
    <p>
      Agreeable Germany!&mdash;who addresses her God, &ldquo;Thou who dwellest high
      above the Cherubim, Seraphim and Zeppelin&rdquo;&mdash;Parson Diedrich Vorwerck
      in his volume Hurrah and Hallelujah. Germany, who says, &ldquo;It is better to
      let a hundred women and children belonging to the enemy die of hunger than
      to let a single German soldier suffer&rdquo;&mdash;General von der Goltz in his
      Ten Iron Commandments of the German Soldier; Germany, whose soldier obeys
      those commandments thus: &ldquo;I am sending you a ring made out of a piece of
      shell.... During the battle of Budonviller I did away with four women and
      seven young girls in five minutes. The Captain had told me to shoot these
      French sows, but I preferred to run my bayonet through them&rdquo;&mdash;private
      Johann Wenger to his German sweetheart, dated Peronne, March 16, 1915.
      Germany, whose newspaper the Cologne Volkszettung deplored the doings of
      her Kultur on land and sea thus: &ldquo;Much as we detest it as human beings and
      as Christians, yet we exult in it as Germans.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
Agreeable Germany!&mdash;whose Kaiser, if his fleet had been larger, would
have taken us by the scruff of the neck.

          &ldquo;Then Thou, Almighty One, send Thy lightnings!
Let dwellings and cottages become ashes in the heat of fire. Let the
people in hordes burn and drown with wife and child. May their seed be
trampled under our feet; May we kill great and small in the lust of joy.
May we plunge our daggers into their bodies, May Poland reek in the glow
of fire and ashes.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      That is another verse of Germany&rsquo;s hymn, hate for Poland; that is her way
      of taking people by the scruff of the neck; and that is what Senator
      Walsh&rsquo;s resolution of sympathy with Ireland, Germany&rsquo;s contemplated
      Heligoland, implies for the United States, if Germany&rsquo;s deferred day
      should come.

    <h2>
      Chapter XVIII: The Will to Friendship&mdash;or the Will to Hate?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nations do not like each other. No plainer fact stares at us from the
      pages of history since the beginning. Are we to sit down under this
      forever? Why should we make no attempt to change this for the better in
      the pages of history that are yet to be written? Other evils have been
      made better. In this very war, the outcry against Germany has been because
      she deliberately brought back into war the cruelties and the horrors of
      more barbarous times, and with cold calculations of premeditated science
      made these horrors worse. Our recoil from this deed of hers and what it
      has brought upon the world is seen in our wish for a League of Nations.
      The thought of any more battles, tenches, submarines, air-raids,
      starvation, misery, is so unbearable to our bruised and stricken minds,
      that we have put it into words whose import is, Let us have no more of
      this! We have at least put it into words. That such words, that such a
      League, can now grow into something more than words, is the hope of many,
      the doubt of many, the belief of a few. It is the belief of Mr. Wilson; of
      Mr. Taft; Lord Bryce; and of Lord Grey, a quiet Englishman, whose
      statesmanship during those last ten murky days of July, 1914, when he
      strove to avert the dreadful years that followed, will shine bright and
      permanent. We must not be chilled by the doubters. Especially is the
      scheme doubted in dear old Europe. Dear old Europe is so old; we are so
      young; we cause her to smile. Yet it is not such a contemptible thing to
      be young and innocent. Only, your innocence, while it makes you an
      idealist, must not blind you to the facts. Your idea must not rest upon
      sand. It must have a little rock to start with. The nearest rock in sight
      is friendship between England and ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The will to friendship&mdash;or the will to hate? Which do you choose?
      Which do you think is the best foundation for the League of Nations? Do
      you imagine that so long as nations do not like each other, that mere
      words of good intention, written on mere paper, are going to be enough?
      Write down the words by all means, but see to it that behind your words
      there shall exist actual good will. Discourage histories for children (and
      for grown-ups too) which breed international dislike. Such exist among us
      all. There is a recent one, written in England, that needs some changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Should an Englishman say to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the will to friendship. Is there any particular thing which I can
      do to help?&rdquo; I should answer him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just now, or in any days to come, should you be tempted to remind us that
      we did not protest against the martyrdom of Belgium, that we were a bit
      slow in coming into the war,&mdash;oh, don&rsquo;t utter that reproach! Go back
      to your own past; look, for instance, at your guarantee to Denmark, at
      Lord John Russell&rsquo;s words: &lsquo;Her Majesty could not see with indifference a
      military occupation of Holstein&rsquo;&mdash;and then see what England shirked;
      and read that scathing sentence spoken to her ambassador in Russia: &lsquo;Then
      we may dismiss any idea that England will fight on a point of honor.&rsquo; We
      had made you no such guarantee. We were three thousand miles away&mdash;how
      far was Denmark?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And another thing. On August 6, 1919, when Britain&rsquo;s thanks to her land
      and sea forces were moved in both houses of Parliament, the gentleman who
      moved them in the House of Lords said something which, as it seems to me,
      adds nothing to the tribute he had already paid so eloquently. He had
      spoken of the greater incentive to courage which the French and Belgians
      had, because their homes and soil were invaded, while England&rsquo;s soldiers
      had suffered no invasion of their island. They had not the stimulus of the
      knowledge that the frontier of their country had been violated, their
      homes broken up, their families enslaved, or worse. And then he added: &lsquo;I
      have sometimes wondered in my own mind, though I have hardly dared confess
      the sentiment, whether the gallant troops of our Allies would have fought
      with equal spirit and so long a time as they did, had they been engaged in
      the Highlands of Scotland or on the marches of the Welsh border.&rsquo; Why
      express that wonder? Is there not here an instance of that needless
      overlooking of the feelings of others, by which, in times past, you have
      chilled those others? Look out for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And should an American say to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the will to friendship. What can I personally do?&rdquo; I should say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Play fair! Look over our history from that Treaty of Paris in 1783, down
      through the Louisiana Purchase, the Monroe Doctrine, and Manila Bay; look
      at the facts. You will see that no matter how acrimoniously England has
      quarreled with us, these were always family scraps, in which she held out
      for her own interests just as we did for ours. But whenever the question
      lay between ourselves and Spain, or France, or Germany, or any foreign
      power, England stood with us against them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And another thing. Not all Americans boast, but we have a reputation for
      boasting. Our Secretary of the Navy gave our navy the whole credit for
      transporting our soldiers to Europe when England did more than half of it.
      At Annapolis there has been a poster, showing a big American sailor with a
      doughboy on his back, and underneath the words, &lsquo;We put them across.&rsquo; A
      brigadier general has written a book entitled, How the Marines Saved
      Paris. Beside the marines there were some engineers. And how about M
      Company of the 23rd regiment of the 2nd Division? It lost in one day at
      Chateau-Thierry all its men but seven. And did the general forget the 3rd
      Division between Chateau-Thierry and Dormans? Don&rsquo;t be like that brigadier
      general, and don&rsquo;t be like that American officer returning on the Lapland
      who told the British at his table he was glad to get home after cleaning
      up the mess which the British had made. Resemble as little as possible our
      present Secretary of the Navy. Avoid boasting. Our contribution to victory
      was quite enough without boasting. The head-master of one of our great
      schools has put it thus to his schoolboys who fought: Some people had to
      raise a hundred dollars. After struggling for years they could only raise
      seventy-five. Then a man came along and furnished the remaining necessary
      twenty-five dollars. That is a good way to put it. What good would our
      twenty-five dollars have been, and where should we have been, if the other
      fellows hadn&rsquo;t raised the seventy-five dollars first?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      Chapter XIX: Lion and Cub
    </h2>
    <p>
      My task is done. I have discussed with as much brevity as I could the
      three foundations of our ancient grudge against England: our school
      textbooks, our various controversies from the Revolution to the Alaskan
      boundary dispute, and certain differences in customs and manners. Some of
      our historians to whom I refer are themselves affected by the ancient
      grudge. You will see this if you read them; you will find the facts, which
      they give faithfully, and you will also find that they often (and I think
      unconsciously) color such facts as are to England&rsquo;s discredit and leave
      pale such as are to her credit, just as we remember the Alabama, and
      forget the Lancashire cotton-spinners. You cannot fail to find, unless
      your anti-English complex tilts your judgment incurably, that England has
      been to us, on the whole, very much more friendly than unfriendly&mdash;if
      not at the beginning, certainly at the end of each controversy. What an
      anti-English complex can do in the face of 1914, is hard to imagine:
      Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, the Boers, all Great Britain&rsquo;s
      colonies, coming across the world to pour their gold and their blood out
      for her! She did not ask them; she could not force them; of their own free
      will they did it. In the whole story of mankind such a splendid tribute of
      confidence and loyalty has never before been paid to any nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this many-peopled world England is our nearest relation. From Bonaparte
      to the Kaiser, never has she allowed any outsider to harm us. We are her
      cub. She has often clawed us, and we have clawed her in return. This will
      probably go on. Once earlier in these pages, I asked the reader not to
      misinterpret me, and now at the end I make the same request. I have not
      sought to persuade him that Great Britain is a charitable institution.
      What nation is, or could be, given the nature of man? Her good treatment
      of us has been to her own interest. She is wise, farseeing, less of an
      opportunist in her statesmanship than any other nation. She has seen
      clearly and ever more clearly that our good will was to her advantage. And
      beneath her wisdom, at the bottom of all, is her sense of our kinship
      through liberty defined and assured by law. If we were so far-seeing as
      she is, we also should know that her good will is equally important to us:
      not alone for material reasons, or for the sake of our safety, but also
      for those few deep, ultimate ideals of law, liberty, life, manhood and
      womanhood, which we share with her, which we got from her, because she is
      our nearest relation in this many-peopled world.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
